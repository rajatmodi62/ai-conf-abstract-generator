English Alphabet Recognition with Telephone Speech
Mark Fanty, Ronald Cole, Krist Roginski
A recognition system is reported which recognizes names spelled over the  telephone with brief pauses between letters. The system uses separate  neural networks to locate segment boundaries and classify letters. The  letter scores are then used to search a database of names to find the best  scoring name. The speaker-independent classification rate for spoken let(cid:173) ters is 89%. The system retrieves the correct name, spelled with pauses  between letters, 91 % of the time from a database of 50,000 names.

Recognizing Overlapping Hand-Printed Characters by Centered-Object Integrated Segmentation and Recognition
Gale L. Martin, Mosfeq Rashid
This paper describes an approach, called centered object integrated seg(cid:173) mentation and recognition (COISR). for integrating object segmenta(cid:173) tion and recognition within a single neural network. The application  is hand-printed character recognition. 1\vo versions of the system are  described. One uses a backpropagation network that scans exhaus(cid:173) tively over a field of characters and is trained to recognize whether  it is centered over a single character or between characters. When  it is centered over a character, the net classifies the cnaracter. The  approach is tested on a dataset of hand-printed digits. Vel)' low errOr  rates are reported. The second version, COISR-SACCADE, avoids  the need for exhaustive scans. The net is trained as before. but also  is trained to compute ballistic 'eye' movements that enable the input  window to jump from one character to the next.

Adaptive Soft Weight Tying using Gaussian Mixtures
Steven Nowlan, Geoffrey E. Hinton
One way  of simplifying neural  networks  so  they generalize  better is  to add  an  extra  t.erm  10  the  error  fUll ction  that  will  penalize  complexit.y.  \Ve  propose  a  new  penalt.y  t.erm  in  which  the  dist rihution  of  weight  values  is  modelled  as  a  mixture  of  multiple  gaussians .  C nder  this  model,  a  set  of  weights  is  simple  if  the  weights  can  be  clustered  into  subsets  so  that  the  weights  in  each  cluster  have  similar  values .  We  allow  the  parameters  of  the  mixture  model  to  adapt  at  t.he  same  time  as  t.he  network  learns.  Simulations demonstrate  that  this complexity  term  is  more  effective  than  previous  complexity terms.

Multi-State Time Delay Networks for Continuous Speech Recognition
Patrick Haffner, Alex Waibel
We present the "Multi-State Time Delay Neural Network" (MS-TDNN) as  an  extension of the TDNN to robust word recognition. Unlike most other hybrid  methods. the MS-TDNN embeds an alignment search procedure into the con(cid:173) nectionist architecture. and allows for word level supervision. The resulting  system  has the ability to manage the sequential order of subword units. while  optimizing for the recognizer performance. In this paper we present extensive  new evaluations of this approach over speaker-dependent and speaker-indepen(cid:173) dent connected alphabet.

Neural Network - Gaussian Mixture Hybrid for Speech Recognition or Density Estimation
Yoshua Bengio, Renato De Mori, Giovanni Flammia, Ralf Kompe
The subject of this paper is the integration of multi-layered Artificial Neu(cid:173) ral Networks (ANN) with probability density functions such as Gaussian  mixtures found in continuous density Hidden Markov Models (HMM). In  the first part of this paper we present an ANN/HMM hybrid in which  all the parameters of the the system are simultaneously optimized with  respect to a single criterion. In the second part of this paper, we study  the relationship between the density of the inputs of the network and the  density of the outputs of the networks. A few experiments are presented  to explore how to perform density estimation with ANNs.

Threshold Network Learning in the Presence of Equivalences
John Shawe-Taylor
This  paper  applies  the  theory  of Probably  Approximately  Correct  (PAC)  learning  to  multiple  output  feedforward  threshold  networks  in  which  the  weights  conform  to  certain  equivalences.  It is  shown that  the sample  size  for  reliable  learning  can  be  bounded  above  by  a  formula  similar  to  that  required  for  single  output  networks  with  no equivalences.  The best  previ(cid:173) ously obtained  bounds  are improved for  all  cases.

Node Splitting: A Constructive Algorithm for Feed-Forward Neural Networks
Mike Wynne-Jones
A constructive algorithm is proposed for feed-forward neural networks,  which uses node-splitting in the hidden layers to build large networks from  smaller ones. The small network forms an approximate model of a set of  training data, and the split creates a larger more powerful network which is  initialised with the approximate solution already found. The insufficiency  of the smaller network in modelling the system which generated the data  leads to oscillation in those hidden nodes whose weight vectors cover re(cid:173) gions in the input space where more detail is required in the model. These  nodes are identified and split in two using principal component analysis,  allowing the new nodes t.o cover the two main modes of each oscillating  vector. Nodes are selected for splitting using principal component analysis  on the oscillating weight vectors, or by examining the Hessian matrix of  second derivatives of the network error with respect to the weight.s. The  second derivat.ive method can also be applied to the input layer, where it  provides a useful indication of t.he relative import.ances of parameters for  the classification t.ask. Node splitting in a standard Multi Layer Percep(cid:173) t.ron is equivalent to introducing a hinge in the decision boundary to allow  more detail to be learned. Initial results were promising, but further eval(cid:173) uation indicates that the long range effects of decision boundaries cause  the new nodes to slip back to the old node position, and nothing is gained.  This problem does not occur in networks of localised receptive fields such  as radial basis functions or gaussian mixtures, where the t.echnique appears  to work well.

Structural Risk Minimization for Character Recognition
I. Guyon, V. Vapnik, B. Boser, L. Bottou, S. A. Solla
The method of Structural Risk Minimization refers to tuning the capacity  of the classifier to the available amount of training data. This capac(cid:173) ity is influenced by several factors, including: (1) properties of the input  space, (2) nature and structure of the classifier, and (3) learning algorithm.  Actions based on these three factors are combined here to control the ca(cid:173) pacity of linear classifiers and improve generalization on the problem of  handwritten digit recognition.

Improved Hidden Markov Model Speech Recognition Using Radial Basis Function Networks
Elliot Singer, Richard P. Lippmann
A high performance speaker-independent isolated-word hybrid speech rec(cid:173) ognizer was developed which combines Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)  and Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks. In recognition ex(cid:173) periments using a speaker-independent E-set database, the hybrid rec(cid:173) ognizer had an error rate of 11.5% compared to 15.7% for the robust  unimodal Gaussian HMM recognizer upon which the hybrid system was  based. These results and additional experiments demonstrate that RBF  networks can be successfully incorporated in hybrid recognizers and sug(cid:173) gest that they may be capable of good performance with fewer parameters  than required by Gaussian mixture classifiers. A global parameter opti(cid:173) mization method designed to minimize the overall word error rather than  the frame recognition error failed to reduce the error rate.

Principled Architecture Selection for Neural Networks: Application to Corporate Bond Rating Prediction
John Moody, Joachim Utans
The notion of generalization ability can be defined precisely as the pre(cid:173) diction risk, the expected performance of an estimator in predicting new  observations. In this paper, we propose the prediction risk as a measure  of the generalization ability of multi-layer perceptron networks and use it  to select an optimal network architecture from a set of possible architec(cid:173) tures. We also propose a heuristic search strategy to explore the space of  possible architectures. The prediction risk is estimated from the available  data; here we estimate the prediction risk by v-fold cross-validation and  by asymptotic approximations of generalized cross-validation or Akaike's  final prediction error. We apply the technique to the problem of predicting  corporate bond ratings. This problem is very attractive as a case study,  since it is characterized by the limited availability of the data and by the  lack of a complete a priori model which could be used to impose a structure  to the network architecture.

Extracting and Learning an Unknown Grammar with Recurrent Neural Networks
C. L. Giles, C. B. Miller, D. Chen, G. Z. Sun, H. H. Chen, Y. C. Lee
Simple secood-order recurrent netwoIts are shown to readily learn sman brown  regular grammars when trained with positive and negative strings examples. We  show that similar methods are appropriate for learning unknown grammars from  examples of their strings. TIle training algorithm is an incremental real-time, re(cid:173) current learning (RTRL) method that computes the complete gradient and updates  the weights at the end of each string. After or during training. a dynamic clustering  algorithm extracts the production rules that the neural network has learned.. TIle  methods are illustrated by extracting rules from unknown deterministic regular  grammars. For many cases the extracted grammar outperforms the neural net from  which it was extracted in correctly classifying unseen strings.

Network activity determines spatio-temporal integration in single cells
√ñjvind Bernander, Christof Koch, Rodney Douglas
Single nerve cells with static properties have traditionally been viewed  as the building blocks for networks that show emergent phenomena. In  contrast to this approach, we study here how the overall network activity  can control single cell parameters such as input resistance, as well as time  and space constants, parameters that are crucial for excitability and spatio(cid:173) temporal integration. Using detailed computer simulations of neocortical  pyramidal cells, we show that the spontaneous background firing of the  network provides a means for setting these parameters. The mechanism  for this control is through the large conductance change of the membrane  that is induced by both non-NMDA and NMDA excitatory and inhibitory  synapses activated by the spontaneous background activity.

Image Segmentation with Networks of Variable Scales

We  developed  a  neural  net  architecture  for  segmenting  complex  images, i.e.,  to localize two-dimensional geometrical shapes in a scene,  without  prior knowledge  of the  objects'  positions  and  sizes.  A  scale  variation is built into the network  to deal with varying sizes.  This algo(cid:173) rithm  has  been  applied  to  video  images  of railroad  cars,  to  find  their  identification  numbers.  Over  95%  of  the  characlers  were  located  correctly in a data base of 300 images, despile a large variation in light(cid:173) ing  conditions and  often a poor quality of the characters.  A part of the  network  is executed  on  a processor board containing an  analog  neural  net chip (Graf et aI.  1991). while the rest is  implemented as  a software  model on a workstation or a digital signal processor.

Learning in Feedforward Networks with Nonsmooth Functions
Nicholas Redding, T. Downs
This paper is concerned with the problem of learning in networks where some  or all of the functions involved are not smooth. Examples of such networks are  those whose neural transfer functions are piecewise-linear and those whose error  function is defined in terms of the 100 norm.  Up to now, networks whose neural transfer functions are piecewise-linear have  received very little consideration in the literature, but the possibility of using an  error function defined in terms of the 100 norm has received some attention. In  this latter work, however, the problems that can occur when gradient methods are  used for non smooth error functions have not been addressed.  In this paper we draw upon some recent results from the field of nonsmooth  optimization (NSO) to present an algorithm for the non smooth case. Our moti(cid:173) vation for this work arose out of the fact that we have been able to show that,  in backpropagation, an error function based upon the 100 norm overcomes the  difficulties which can occur when using the 12 norm.

Constructing Proofs in Symmetric Networks
Gadi Pinkus
This paper considers the problem of expressing predicate calculus in con(cid:173) nectionist networks that are based  on energy minimization.  Given a  first(cid:173) order-logic  knowledge  base and a  bound  k,  a  symmetric  network is  con(cid:173) structed  (like a  Boltzman  machine  or a  Hopfield  network)  that searches  for  a  proof for  a  given  query.  If a  resolution-based  proof of length  no  longer  than k  exists,  then the global  minima of the energy function  that  is  associated  with  the  network represent such  proofs.  The  network  that  is  generated  is  of size  cubic  in  the bound  k  and  linear in the  knowledge  size.  There are no restrictions on the type of logic  formulas  that can be  represented.  The network  is  inherently fault  tolerant and  can cope with  inconsistency and nonmonotonicity.

A Weighted Probabilistic Neural Network
David Montana
The Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) algorithm represents the likeli(cid:173) hood function of a given class as the sum of identical, isotropic Gaussians.  In practice, PNN is often an excellent pattern classifier, outperforming  other classifiers including backpropagation. However, it. is not. robust with  respect to affine transformations of feature space, and this can lead to  poor performance on certain data. We have derived an extension of PNN  called Weighted PNN (WPNN) which compensates for this flaw by allow(cid:173) ing anisotropic Gaussians, i.e. Gaussians whose covariance is not a mul(cid:173) tiple of the identity matrix. The covariance is optimized using a genetic  algorithm, some interesting features of which are its redundant, logarith(cid:173) mic encoding and large population size. Experimental results validate our  claims.

Shooting Craps in Search of an Optimal Strategy for Training Connectionist Pattern Classifiers
J. B. Hampshire II, B. Kumar
We compare two strategies for training connectionist (as well as non(cid:173) connectionist) models for statistical pattern recognition. The probabilistic strat(cid:173) egy is based on the notion that Bayesian discrimination (i.e .‚Ä¢ optimal classifica(cid:173) tion) is achieved when the classifier learns the a posteriori class distributions of  the random feature vector. The differential strategy is based on the notion that  the identity of the largest class a posteriori probability of the feature vector is  all that is needed to achieve Bayesian discrimination. Each strategy is directly  linked to a family of objective functions that can be used in the supervised training  procedure. We prove that the probabilistic strategy - linked with error measure  objective functions such as mean-squared-error and cross-entropy - typically  used to train classifiers necessarily requires larger training sets and more complex  classifier architectures than those needed to approximate the Bayesian discrim(cid:173) linked  inant function.  In contrast. we prove that the differential strategy - with classificationfigure-of-merit objective functions (CF'MmoIlO) [3] - requires  the minimum classifier functional complexity and the fewest training examples  necessary to approximate the Bayesian discriminant function with specified pre(cid:173) cision (measured in probability of error). We present our proofs in the context of  a game of chance in which an unfair C-sided die is tossed repeatedly. We show  that this rigged game of dice is a paradigm at the root of all statistical pattern  recognition tasks. and demonstrate how a simple extension of the concept leads  us to a general information-theoretic model of sample complexity for statistical  pattern recognition.

Multimodular Architecture for Remote Sensing Operations.

This paper deals with an application of Neural Networks to satellite  remote sensing observations. Because of the complexity of the  application and the large amount of data, the problem cannot be solved  by using a single method. The solution we propose is to build multi(cid:173) modules NN architectures where several NN cooperate together. Such  system suffer from generic problem for whom we propose solutions.  They allow to reach accurate performances for multi-valued function  approximations and probability estimations. The results are compared  with six other methods which have been used for this problem. We  show that the methodology we have developed is general and can be  used for a large variety of applications.

Learning in the Vestibular System: Simulations of Vestibular Compensation Using Recurrent Back-Propagation
Thomas Anastasio
Vestibular  compensation  is  the  process  whereby  normal  functioning  is  regained  following  destruction  of  one  member  of  the  pair  of  peripheral  vestibular  receptors.  Compensation  was  simulated  by  lesioning  a  dynamic  neural  network  model  of the  vestibulo~ular reflex  (VOR)  and  retraining  it  using  recurrent back-propagation.  The model reproduced the pattern of VOR  neuron activity  experimentally observed  in compensated animals,  but only  if  connections  heretofore  considered  uninvolved  were  allowed  to  be  plastic.  Because  the  model  incorporated  nonlinear  units,  it  was  able  to  reconcile  previously conflicting, linear analyses of experimental  results on the dynamic  properties of VOR neurons in normal and compensated animals.

The KBANN approach uses neural networks to refine knowledge that can  be written in the form of simple propositional rules. We extend this idea  further by presenting the MANNCON algorithm by which the mathematical  equations governing a PID controller determine the topology and initial  weights of a network, which is further trained using backpropagation. We  apply this method to the task of controlling the outflow and temperature  of a water tank, producing statistically-significant gains in accuracy over  both a standard neural network approach and a non-learning PID con(cid:173) troller. Furthermore, using the PID knowledge to initialize the weights of  the network produces statistically less variation in testset accuracy when  compared to networks initialized with small random numbers.

A neurophysiologically-based model is presented that controls a simulated  kinematic arm during goal-directed reaches. The network generates a  quasi-feedforward motor command that is learned using training signals  generated by corrective movements. For each target, the network selects  and sets the output of a subset of pattern generators. During the move(cid:173) ment, feedback from proprioceptors turns off the pattern generators. The  task facing individual pattern generators is to recognize when the arm  reaches the target and to turn off.

Linear Operator for Object Recognition
Ronen Basri, Shimon Ullman
Visual  object  recognition  involves  the  identification of images of 3-D  ob(cid:173) jects seen  from  arbitrary  viewpoints.  We  suggest  an  approach  to object  recognition  in  which  a  view  is  represented  as  a  collection  of points  given  by their location in the image.  An object is  modeled by a set of 2-D views  together  with  the  correspondence  between  the  views.  We show that  any  novel  view  of the  object  can  be expressed  as a  linear  combination  of the  stored  views.  Consequently,  we  build  a  linear operator that  distinguishes  between views of a specific object and views of other objects.  This opera(cid:173) tor can be implemented using neural network architectures with relatively  simple structures.

Do you  want  your  neural  net  algorithm  to learn  sequences?  Do not lim(cid:173) it  yourself to  conventional  gradient  descent  (or  approximations  thereof).  Instead,  use  your sequence  learning  algorithm  (any will  do)  to implement  the  following  method  for  history  compression.  No  matter  what  your  fi(cid:173) nal goals  are,  train  a  network  to predict  its next input from  the  previous  ones.  Since  only  unpredictable  inputs  convey  new  information, ignore  all  predictable  inputs  but let  all  unexpected  inputs  (plus  information  about  the  time  step  at  which  they  occurred)  become  inputs  to  a  higher-level  network of the same kind  (working on a  slower,  self-adjusting  time scale).  Go on  building  a  hierarchy  of such  networks.  This  principle  reduces  the  descriptions  of event  sequences  without  1088  of information,  thus  easing  supervised  or  reinforcement  learning  tasks.  Alternatively,  you  may  use  two recurrent  networks  to collapse  a  multi-level  predictor hierarchy  into a  single  recurrent  net.  Experiments  show  that systems based on  these prin(cid:173) ciples  can require less  computation per  time step and many fewer  training  sequences  than conventional training algorithms for  recurrent  nets.  Final(cid:173) ly you can modify the above method such that predictability is not defined  in  a  yes-or-no fashion  but in a  continuous fashion.

We study a particular type of Boltzmann machine with a bipartite graph structure called a harmo(cid:173) nium.

We analyze the class of probability distributions that can be modeled by such machines.  showing that for each n ~ 1 this class includes arbitrarily good appwximations to any distribution  on the set of all n-vectors of binary inputs. We then present two learning algorithms for these  machines .. The first learning algorithm is the standard gradient ascent heuristic for computing  maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters (i.e. weights and thresholds) of the modeL Here  we give a closed form for this gradient that is significantly easier to compute than the corresponding  gradient for the general Boltzmann machine . The second learning algorithm is a greedy method  that creates the hidden units and computes their weights one at a time. This method is a variant  of the standard method for projection pursuit density estimation . We give experimental results for  these learning methods on synthetic data and natural data from the domain of handwritten digits.

Neural Computing with Small Weights
Kai-Yeung Siu, Jehoshua Bruck
An important issue in neural computation is the dynamic range of weights  in  the  neural  networks.  Many  experimental  results  on  learning  indicate  that  the  weights  in  the  networks  can  grow  prohibitively  large  with  the  size  of the  inputs.  Here  we  address  this  issue  by  studying  the  tradeoffs  between  the  depth  and  the  size  of weights  in  polynomial-size  networks  of linear  threshold  elements  (LTEs).  We  show  that  there  is  an  efficient  way  of simulating  a  network  of LTEs  with  large  weights  by  a  network  of LTEs  with  small weights.  In  particular,  we  prove  that  every  depth-d,  polynomial-size network  of LTEs  with  exponentially  large  integer  weights  can  be  simulated  by  a  depth-(2d + 1),  polynomial-size network  of LTEs  with  polynomially  bounded  integer  weights.  To  prove  these  results,  we  use  tools from  harmonic analysis of Boolean  functions.  Our  technique  is  quite  general,  it  provides  insights  to some other  problems.  For  example,  we  are  able to improve the  best  known  results  on  the  depth  of a  network  of linear  threshold  elements  that  computes the  COM PARI SO N,  SUM  and  PRO DU CT of two  n-bits  numbers,  and  the  MAX 1M U M  and  the  SORTING of n  n-bit numbers.

Learning How to Teach or Selecting Minimal Surface Data

Learning a  map from an input set  to an output set is similar to the prob(cid:173) lem of reconstructing  hypersurfaces  from sparse  data (Poggio and  Girosi,  1990).  In this framework,  we  discuss  the  problem of automatically select(cid:173) ing  "minimal"  surface  data.  The objective  is  to be  able to approximately  reconstruct  the  surface  from the selected  sparse  data.  We  show  that this  problem is  equivalent  to  the  one  of compressing  information by  data re(cid:173) moval and the one oflearning how to teach.  Our key step is to introduce a  process  that statistically selects  the data according  to the  model.  During  the process  of data selection  (learning how  to teach)  our system  (teacher)  is  capable  of predicting  the  new  surface,  the  approximated  one  provided  by  the  selected  data.  We  concentrate  on  piecewise  smooth surfaces,  e.g.  images,  and  use  mean field  techniques  to  obtain a  deterministic  network  that is shown to compress  image data.

Hierarchical Transformation of Space in the Visual System
Alexandre Pouget, Stephen Fisher, Terrence J. Sejnowski
Neurons  encoding  simple  visual  features  in  area  VI  such  as  orientation,  direction  of motion  and  color  are  organized  in  retinotopic  maps.  How(cid:173) ever,  recent  physiological  experiments have  shown  that  the  responses  of  many  neurons  in  VI  and  other  cortical  areas  are  modulated  by  the  di(cid:173) rection of gaze.  We  have developed a  neural  network model of the  visual  cortex to explore the hypothesis that visual  features are encoded in  head(cid:173) centered coordinates at early stages of visual processing.  New experiments  are suggested for  testing this hypothesis using  electrical stimulations and  psychophysical observations.

Constant-Time Loading of Shallow 1-Dimensional Networks
Stephen Judd
The complexity of learning in shallow I-Dimensional neural networks has  been shown elsewhere to be linear in the size of the network. However,  when the network has a huge number of units (as cortex has) even linear  time might be unacceptable. Furthermore, the algorithm that was given to  achieve this time was based on a single serial processor and was biologically  implausible.  In this work we consider the more natural parallel model of processing  and demonstrate an expected-time complexity that is constant (i.e.  dependent of the size of the network). This holds even when inter-node  communication channels are short and local, thus adhering to more bio(cid:173) logical and VLSI constraints.

Combined Neural Network and Rule-Based Framework for Probabilistic Pattern Recognition and Discovery
Hayit K. Greenspan, Rodney Goodman, Rama Chellappa
A combined neural network and rule-based approach is suggested as a  general framework for pattern recognition. This approach enables unsu(cid:173) pervised and supervised learning, respectively, while providing probability  estimates for the output classes. The probability maps are utilized for  higher level analysis such as a feedback for smoothing over the output la(cid:173) bel maps and the identification of unknown patterns (pattern "discovery").  The suggested approach is presented and demonstrated in the texture - analysis task. A correct classification rate in the 90 percentile is achieved  for both unstructured and structured natural texture mosaics. The advan(cid:173) tages of the probabilistic approach to pattern analysis are demonstrated.

We have used this system to do learning  experiments on the parity and replication problem. The system settling time  limits the learning speed to about 100,000 patterns per second roughly  independent of system size.

Against Edges: Function Approximation with Multiple Support Maps
Trevor Darrell, Alex Pentland
Networks for reconstructing a sparse or noisy function often use an edge  field to segment the function into homogeneous regions, This approach  assumes that these regions do not overlap or have disjoint parts, which is  often false. For example, images which contain regions split by an occlud(cid:173) ing object can't be properly reconstructed using this type of network. We  have developed a network that overcomes these limitations, using support  maps to represent the segmentation of a signal. In our approach, the sup(cid:173) port of each region in the signal is explicitly represented. Results from  an initial implementation demonstrate that this method can reconstruct  images and motion sequences which contain complicated occlusion.

Induction of Multiscale Temporal Structure
Michael C. Mozer
Learning  structure  in  temporally-extended  sequences  is  a  difficult  com(cid:173) putational problem because  only a  fraction  of the relevant  information is  available  at  any  instant.  Although  variants  of back  propagation  can  in  principle  be  used  to find  structure in  sequences,  in  practice  they  are  not  sufficiently  powerful  to  discover  arbitrary  contingencies,  especially  those  spanning  long  temporal  intervals  or  involving  high  order  statistics.  For  example,  in  designing  a  connectionist  network for  music  composition,  we  have encountered  the problem that the net is  able to learn  musical struc(cid:173) ture that occurs locally in time-e.g., relations  among notes within a  mu(cid:173) sical phrase-but not structure that occurs over longer time periods--e.g.,  relations  among  phrases.  To  address  this  problem,  we  require  a  means  of constructing  a  reduced  deacription  of the  sequence  that  makes  global  aspects more explicit  or more readily detectable.  I propose to achieve this  using hidden  units that operate with different  time constants.  Simulation  experiments  indicate  that slower  time-scale  hidden  units  are  able  to pick  up global structure,  structure that simply can not be learned  by standard  back propagation.

Single Neuron Model: Response to Weak Modulation in the Presence of Noise
A. R. Bulsara, W. Jacobs
We consider a noisy bist.able single neuron model driven by a periodic  external modulation. The modulation introduces a correlated switching  between st.ates driven by the noise. The information flow through the sys(cid:173) tem from the modulation to the output switching events, leads to a succes(cid:173) sion of strong peaks in the power spectrum. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)  obtained from this power spectrum is a measure of the information content  in the neuron response . With increasing noise intensity, the SNR passes  t.hrough a maximum, an effect which has been called stochastic resonance.  We treat t.he problem wit.hin the framework of a recently developed approx(cid:173) imate theory, valid in the limits of weak noise intensity, weak periodic forc(cid:173) ing and low forcing frequency. A comparison of the results of this theory  with those obtained from a linear syst.em FFT is also presented .

Learning time on an example task, cart(cid:173) pole balancing, is thereby reduced about 50 to 100 times.

The cold spot induced a non monotonic relationship  be(cid:173) tween the strength of the synaptic input and the probability of neuronal  fIring.

The learning algorithm is shown to perform gradient ascent  in a log likelihood function that captures the architecture's hierarchical  structure.

Adaptive Synchronization of Neural and Physical Oscillators
Kenji Doya, Shuji Yoshizawa
Animal  locomotion  patterns  are  controlled  by recurrent  neural  networks  called central pattern generators  (CPGs).  Although  a  CPG  can  oscillate  autonomously,  its  rhythm and  phase  must  be  well  coordinated  with  the  state of the physical system using sensory inputs.  In this paper we propose  a learning algorithm for synchronizing neural and physical oscillators with  specific phase relationships.  Sensory input connections are modified by the  correlation between cellular activities and input signals.  Simulations show  that the learning rule can be used for setting sensory feedback connections  to a  CPG as  well  as coupling connections between CPGs.

Practical ability will be shown in the results of  a competition sponsored by the Puget Sound Power and Light Company,  where the recurrent networks gave the best performance on electric load  forecasting.

Self-organization in real neurons: Anti-Hebb in 'Channel Space'?
Anthony Bell
Ion channels are the dynamical systems of the nervous system. Their  distribution within the membrane governs not only communication of in(cid:173) formation between neurons, but also how that information is integrated  within the cell. Here, an argument is presented for an 'anti-Hebbian' rule  for changing the distribution of voltage-dependent ion channels in order  to flatten voltage curvatures in dendrites. Simulations show that this rule  can account for the self-organisation of dynamical receptive field properties  such as resonance and direction selectivity. It also creates the conditions  for the faithful conduction within the cell of signals to which the cell has  been exposed. Various possible cellular implementations of such a learn(cid:173) ing rule are proposed, including activity-dependent migration of channel  proteins in the plane of the membrane.

Tangent Prop - A formalism for specifying selected invariances in an adaptive network
Patrice Simard, Bernard Victorri, Yann LeCun, John Denker
In many machine learning applications, one has access, not only to training  data, but also to some high-level a priori knowledge about the desired be(cid:173) havior of the system. For example, it is known in advance that the output  of a character recognizer should be invariant with respect to small spa(cid:173) tial distortions of the input images (translations, rotations, scale changes,  etcetera).  We have implemented a scheme that allows a network to learn the deriva(cid:173) tive of its outputs with respect to distortion operators of our choosing.  This not only reduces the learning time and the amount of training data,  but also provides a powerful language for specifying what generalizations  we wish the network to perform.

Practical Issues in Temporal Difference Learning

This  paper  examines  whether  temporal  difference  methods  for  training  connectionist  networks,  such  as  Suttons's  TO(')  algorithm,  can  be  suc(cid:173) cessfully  applied to complex real-world problems.  A number of important  practical issues are identified and discussed from a general theoretical per(cid:173) spective.  These practical issues are then examined in the context of a case  study  in  which  TO(')  is  applied  to  learning  the  game  of backgammon  from  the  outcome of self-play.  This is  apparently  the  first  application of  this  algorithm  to  a  complex  nontrivial  task.  It is  found  that,  with  zero  knowledge  built  in,  the network  is able  to learn  from  scratch  to  play  the  entire game at a  fairly strong intermediate level of performance,  which  is  clearly  better  than conventional commercial programs, and which  in fact  surpasses  comparable networks  trained  on  a  massive  human expert  data  set.  The hidden  units in  these network  have apparently discovered  useful  features,  a  longstanding  goal of computer  games  research.  Furthermore,  when  a  set  of hand-crafted  features  is  added  to the  input representation,  the resulting networks reach  a  near-expert  level of performance, and have  achieved good results against world-class human play.

A Network of Localized Linear Discriminants
Martin Glassman
The localized linear discriminant network (LLDN) has been designed to address  classification problems containing relatively closely  spaced data from  different  classes  (encounter zones  [1], the accuracy problem  [2]).  Locally trained hyper(cid:173) plane segments are an effective way to define the decision boundaries for these  regions [3].  The LLD uses a modified perceptron training algorithm for effective  discovery of separating hyperplane/sigmoid units within narrow boundaries. The  basic unit of the network is the discriminant receptive field (DRF) which combines  the LLD function with Gaussians representing the dispersion of the local training  data with respect to the hyperplane.  The DRF implements a local distance mea(cid:173) sure [4], and obtains the benefits of networks oflocalized units [5].  A constructive  algorithm for the two-class case is described which incorporates DRF's into the  hidden layer to solve local discrimination problems.  The output unit produces a  smoothed, piecewise linear decision boundary.  Preliminary results  indicate the  ability of the LLDN to efficiently achieve separation when boundaries are narrow  and complex,  in  cases where  both the "standard" multilayer perceptron (MLP)  and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) yield high error rates on training data.

Using short (10- 110 msec) inter-stimulus intervals the resulting hand motions were initially  directed in between the first and second target locations.

I  consider  a  class  of  MDTs,  called  composite  tasks,  formed  by temporally  concatenating a  number  of  simpler, elemental MDTs.  The architecture is  trained on a  set of compos(cid:173) ite and  elemental MDTs.  The  temporal  structure  of a  composite  task  is  assumed  to be  unknown  and the architecture learns  to produce  a  tempo(cid:173) ral  decomposition.  It is  shown  that under certain  conditions  the  solution  of a  composite  MDT can  be  constructed  by computationally inexpensive  modifications of the solutions  of its constituent elemental MDTs.

Benchmarking Feed-Forward Neural Networks: Models and Measures
Leonard Hamey
Existing metrics for the learning performance of feed-forward neural networks do  not provide a satisfactory basis for comparison because the choice of the training  epoch limit can determine the results of the comparison.  I propose new metrics  which  have  the  desirable property of being  independent of the  training epoch  limit.  The efficiency measures  the yield of correct networks in proportion to the  training effort expended.  The optimal epoch limit provides the greatest efficiency.  The learning performance is modelled statistically, and asymptotic performance  is estimated.  Implementation details may be found in (Harney,  1992).

CCD Neural Network Processors for Pattern Recognition
Alice Chiang, Michael Chuang, Jeffrey LaFranchise
A  CCD-based  processor  that we  call  the  NNC2  is  presented.  The  NNC2  implements a  fully  connected  192-input, 32-output two-layer network  and  can  be  cascaded  to  form  multilayer  networks  or  used  in  parallel  for  ad(cid:173) ditional  input or  output  nodes.  The device  computes  1.92  x  109  connec(cid:173) tions/sec when clocked at 10 MHz.  Network weights can be specified to six  bits of accuracy and are stored on-chip in  programmable digital memories.  A  neural  network  pattern  recognition  system using  NNC2  and  CCD  im(cid:173) age  feature  extractor  (IFE)  devices  is  described.  Additionally,  we  report  a  CCD  output  circuit  that  exploits  inherent  nonlinearities  in  the  charge  injection  process to realize  an  adjustable-threshold sigmoid  in  a  chip  area  of 40  x  80  J.tlU2 .

A Simple Weight Decay Can Improve Generalization
Anders Krogh, John Hertz
It has  been observed  in  numerical simulations that a weight decay  can  im(cid:173) prove generalization in a feed-forward  neural network.  This paper explains  why.  It is  proven  that  a  weight  decay  has  two effects  in  a  linear  network.  First,  it  suppresses  any  irrelevant  components  of  the  weight  vector  by  choosing  the smallest  vector  that solves  the learning  problem.  Second,  if  the size  is chosen  right,  a weight  decay  can suppress some of the effects  of  static  noise  on  the  targets,  which  improves  generalization  quite  a  lot.  It  is  then  shown  how  to extend  these  results  to networks  with hidden  layers  and  non-linear  units.  Finally  the  theory  is  confirmed  by  some numerical  simulations using  the  data from  NetTalk.

Obstacle Avoidance through Reinforcement Learning
Tony Prescott, John Mayhew
A  method  is  described  for  generating  plan-like.  reflexive.  obstacle  avoidance behaviour in a mobile robot. The experiments reported here  use  a  simulated  vehicle  with  a  primitive  range  sensor.  Avoidance  behaviour is encoded as a set of continuous functions of the  perceptual  input space. These functions are stored  using CMACs and trained by a  variant of Barto and Sutton's adaptive critic  algorithm.  As  the  vehicle  explores  its  surroundings it adapts  its  responses  to  sensory stimuli  so  as  to  minimise  the  negative  reinforcement  arising  from  collisions.  Strategies  for  local  navigation  are  therefore  acquired  in  an  explicitly  goal-driven  fashion.  The resulting  trajectories  form  elegant collision(cid:173) free paths through the environment

The VC-Dimension versus the Statistical Capacity of Multilayer Networks
Chuanyi Ji, Demetri Psaltis
A  general  relationship  is  developed  between  the  VC-dimension  and  the  statistical lower  epsilon-capacity which shows  that the VC-dimension can  be  lower  bounded  (in  order)  by the statistical  lower epsilon-capacity of a  network  trained  with  random  samples.  This  relationship  explains  quan(cid:173) titatively  how  generalization  takes  place  after  memorization,  and  relates  the concept of generalization (consistency) with the capacity of the optimal  classifier over a class of classifiers with the same structure and the capacity  of the Bayesian classifier.  Furthermore, it provides a general methodology  to evaluate a  lower  bound for  the VC-dimension of feedforward multilayer  neural networks.  This  general  methodology  is  applied  to  two  types  of networks  which  are  important  for  hardware  implementations:  two  layer  (N  - 2L  - 1)  net(cid:173) works  with  binary  weights,  integer  thresholds  for  the  hidden  units  and  zero  threshold  for  the  output  unit,  and  a  single  neuron  ((N - 1)  net(cid:173) works)  with  binary  weigths  and  a  zero  threshold.  Specifically,  we  obtain  OC~L) ::;  d2  ::;  O(W),  and  d1  ""'  O(N).  Here  W  is  the  total  number  of weights  of  the  (N - 2L - 1)  networks.  d1  and  d2  represent  the  VC(cid:173) dimensions  for  the (N - 1)  and  (N - 2L - 1)  networks respectively.

Improving the Performance of Radial Basis Function Networks by Learning Center Locations
Dietrich Wettschereck, Thomas Dietterich
Three methods for improving the performance of (gaussian) radial basis  function (RBF) networks were tested on the NETtaik task. In RBF, a  new example is classified by computing its Euclidean distance to a set of  centers chosen by unsupervised methods. The application of supervised  learning to learn a non-Euclidean distance metric was found to reduce the  error rate of RBF networks, while supervised learning of each center's vari(cid:173) ance resulted in inferior performance. The best improvement in accuracy  was achieved by networks called generalized radial basis function (GRBF)  networks. In GRBF, the center locations are determined by supervised  learning. After training on 1000 words, RBF classifies 56.5% of letters  correct, while GRBF scores 73.4% letters correct (on a separate test set).  From these and other experiments, we conclude that supervised learning  of center locations can be very important for radial basis function learning.

Models Wanted: Must Fit Dimensions of Sleep and Dreaming
J. Hobson, Adam Mamelak, Jeffrey Sutton
During waking and sleep, the brain and mind undergo a  tightly linked and  precisely  specified  set  of changes  in state.  At  the  level  of neurons,  this  process  has  been  modeled  by  variations  of Volterra-Lotka  equations  for  cyclic fluctuations of brainstem cell populations.  However, neural network  models based upon rapidly developing knowledge ofthe specific population  connectivities  and  their  differential responses  to drugs  have  not  yet  been  developed.  Furthermore, only  the  most  preliminary  attempts  have  been  made  to model across states.  Some  of our own attempts  to link rapid eye  movement (REM) sleep neurophysiology and dream cognition using neural  network approaches  are summarized in this  paper.

Merging Constrained Optimisation with Deterministic Annealing to "Solve" Combinatorially Hard Problems
Paul Stolorz
Several parallel analogue algorithms, based upon mean field theory (MFT)  approximations to an underlying statistical mechanics formulation, and re(cid:173) quiring an externally prescribed annealing schedule, now exist for finding  approximate solutions to difficult combinatorial optimisation problems.  They have been applied to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), as  well as to various issues in computational vision and cluster analysis. I  show here that any given MFT algorithm can be combined in a natural  way with notions from the areas of constrained optimisation and adaptive  simulated annealing to yield a single homogenous and efficient parallel re(cid:173) laxation technique, for which an externally prescribed annealing schedule  is no longer required. The results of numerical simulations on 50-city and  100-city TSP problems are presented, which show that the ensuing algo(cid:173) rithms are typically an order of magnitude faster than the MFT algorithms  alone, and which also show, on occasion, superior solutions as well.

Neural Control for Rolling Mills: Incorporating Domain Theories to Overcome Data Deficiency

In  a  Bayesian  framework,  we  give  a  principled  account  of how  domain(cid:173) specific prior knowledge such  as imperfect analytic domain theories can be  optimally  incorporated  into  networks  of locally-tuned  units:  by  choosing  a  specific  architecture  and  by  applying  a  specific  training  regimen.  Our  method  proved  successful  in  overcoming  the  data  deficiency  problem  in  a  large-scale  application  to  devise  a  neural  control  for  a  hot  line  rolling  mill.  It  achieves  in  this  application  significantly  higher  accuracy  than  optimally-tuned standard  algorithms such  as  sigmoidal backpropagation,  and  outperforms the state-of-the-art solution.

Polynomial Uniform Convergence of Relative Frequencies to Probabilities
Alberto Bertoni, Paola Campadelli, Anna Morpurgo, Sandra Panizza
We  define  the  concept  of  polynomial  uniform  convergence  of  relative  frequencies  to  probabilities  in  the  distribution-dependent  context.  Let  Xn  = {O, l}n, let Pn be a  probability distribution on Xn  and let Fn  C  2X ,.  be  a  family  of events.  The  family  {(Xn, Pn, Fn)}n~l  has  the  property  of polynomial uniform  convergence  if the  probability  that  the  maximum  difference  (over  Fn)  between  the  relative  frequency  and  the  probabil(cid:173) ity  of  an  event  exceed  a  given  positive  e  be  at  most  6  (0  <  6  <  1),  when  the sample on  which  the frequency  is  evaluated  has size  polynomial  in  n,l/e,l/b.  Given  at-sample  (Xl, ... ,Xt),  let  C~t)(XI, ... ,Xt)  be  the  Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of the family {{x}, ... ,xtl n f  I f  E  Fn}  and  M(n, t)  the  expectation  E(C~t) It).  We  show  that  {(Xn, Pn, Fn)}n~l  has  the  property of polynomial uniform convergence  iff there exists  f3  > 0  such  that  M(n, t)  = O(n/t!3).  Applications  to  distribution-dependent  PAC learning are discussed.

Using  real physiological data - articulator movements and EMG from  muscle activity(cid:173) a  neural  network  learns  the  forward  dynamics  relating  motor  commands  to  muscles  and  the  ensuing  articulator  behavior.  After  learning,  simulated  perturbations, were used to asses properties of the acquired model, such as natural  frequency,  damping,  and  interarticulator  couplings.  Finally,  a  cascade neural  network is  used  to  generate  continuous  motor commands from  a  sequence  of  discrete articulatory targets.

Learning to Segment Images Using Dynamic Feature Binding
Michael C. Mozer, Richard Zemel, Marlene Behrmann
Despite  the fact  that complex visual  scenes  contain multiple,  overlapping  objects,  people  perform  object  recognition  with  ease  and accuracy.  One  operation  that facilitates  recognition  is  an early  segmentation  process  in  which  features of objects are grouped and labeled  according  to which  ob(cid:173) ject they belong.  Current computational systems  that perform this oper(cid:173) ation  are based  on predefined  grouping heuristics.  We  describe  a  system  called  MAGIC  that  learn.  how  to  group  features  based  on  a  set  of pre(cid:173) segmented  examples.  In many cases,  MAGIC  discovers  grouping heuristics  similar to those previously proposed, but it also has the capability of find(cid:173) ing  nonintuitive  structural regularities  in images.  Grouping is  performed  by  a  relaxation  network  that  aUempts  to  dynamically  bind  related  fea(cid:173) tures.  Features  transmit  a  complex-valued  signal  (amplitude  and  phase)  to one another;  binding  can thus be represented  by phase locking  related  features.  MAGIC'S  training  procedure is  a  generalization  of recurrent  back  propagation to complex-valued units.

Neural Network Analysis of Event Related Potentials and Electroencephalogram Predicts Vigilance
Rita Venturini, William Lytton, Terrence J. Sejnowski
Automated  monitoring  of  vigilance  in  attention  intensive  tasks  such  as  air  traffic  control  or  sonar  operation  is  highly  desirable.  As  the  opera(cid:173) tor monitors the  instrument,  the  instrument  would  monitor the operator,  insuring against lapses.  We  have taken a first  step  toward this goal by  us(cid:173) ing feedforward neural networks trained with backpropagation to interpret  event  related  potentials  (ERPs)  and electroencephalogram  (EEG)  associ(cid:173) ated with periods of high and low vigilance.  The accuracy of our system on  an ERP data set  averaged  over  28  minutes was  96%,  better than the 83%  accuracy  obtained  using  linear  discriminant  analysis.  Practical  vigilance  monitoring will require prediction over shorter time periods.  We were  able  to  average  the  ERP  over  as  little  as  2  minutes  and  still  get  90%  correct  prediction of a vigilance measure.  Additionally, we  achieved similarly good  performance  using segments of EEG  power  spectrum  as  short  as  56  sec.

A Comparison of Projection Pursuit and Neural Network Regression Modeling

Two  projection  based  feedforward  network  learning  methods  for  model(cid:173) free  regression  problems  are  studied  and  compared  in  this  paper:  one  is  the  popular  back-propagation learning  (BPL);  the  other  is  the  projection  pursuit learning  (PPL).  Unlike  the  totally  parametric  BPL  method,  the  PPL  non-parametrically  estimates  unknown  nonlinear  functions  sequen(cid:173) tially (neuron-by-neuron and layer-by-Iayer) at each iteration while jointly  estimating  the  interconnection  weights.  In  terms  of  learning  efficiency,  both  methods  have  comparable  training  speed  when  based  on  a  Gauss(cid:173) Newton  optimization  algorithm  while  the  PPL  is  more  parsimonious.  In  terms of learning robustness  toward noise  outliers,  the  BPL is  more sensi(cid:173) tive to  the  outliers.

Fast, Robust Adaptive Control by Learning only Forward Models
Andrew Moore
A  large  class  of motor control  tasks  requires  that on  each cycle  the con(cid:173) troller  is  told  its  current  state  and  must  choose  an  action  to  achieve  a  specified,  state-dependent,  goal  behaviour.  This  paper  argues  that  the  optimization  of  learning  rate,  the  number  of experimental  control  deci(cid:173) sions before adequate performance is obtained, and  robustness is of prime  importance-if necessary  at  the  expense  of computation  per  control  cy(cid:173) cle  and  memory  requirement.  This  is  motivated  by  the observation  that  a  robot  which  requires  two  thousand  learning  steps  to  achieve  adequate  performance, or a  robot  which occasionally gets stuck while learning,  will  always  be  undesirable,  whereas  moderate  computational  expense  can  be  accommodated by increasingly powerful computer hardware.  It is  not un(cid:173) reasonable  to assume  the  existence  of inexpensive  100  Mflop  controllers  within  a  few  years  and  so  even  processes  with  control  cycles  in  the  low  tens of milliseconds  will  have millions of machine instructions in  which to  make their decisions.  This paper outlines a learning control scheme which  aims to make effective use of such computational power.

Green's Function Method for Fast On-Line Learning Algorithm of Recurrent Neural Networks
Guo-Zheng Sun, Hsing-Hen Chen, Yee-Chun Lee
The two well known learning algorithms of recurrent neural networks are  the back-propagation (Rumelhart & el al.,  Werbos) and the  forward propa(cid:173) gation (Williams and Zipser). The main drawback of back-propagation is  its  off-line backward path in time for error cumulation. This violates the on-line  requirement in many  practical applications.  Although the  forward propaga(cid:173) tion algorithm can be used in an on-line manner, the annoying drawback is  the heavy computation load required to update the high dimensional sensitiv(cid:173) ity matrix (0( fir) operations for each time step). Therefore, to develop a fast  forward algorithm is a challenging task. In this paper w~ proposed a forward  learning algorithm which is one order faster (only 0(fV3) operations for each  time step) than the sensitivity matrix algorithm. The basic idea is that instead  of integrating  the  high  dimensional  sensitivity dynamic  equation  we  solve  forward in time for its Green's function to avoid the redundant computations,  and then update the weights whenever the error is to be corrected.

Constrained Optimization Applied to the Parameter Setting Problem for Analog Circuits
David Kirk, Kurt Fleischer, Lloyd Watts, Alan Barr
We use constrained optimization to select operating parameters for two  circuits: a simple 3-transistor square root circuit, and an analog VLSI  artificial cochlea. This automated method uses computer controlled mea(cid:173) surement and test equipment to choose chip parameters which minimize  the difference between the actual circuit's behavior and a specified goal  behavior. Choosing the proper circuit parameters is important to com(cid:173) pensate for manufacturing deviations or adjust circuit performance within  a certain range. As biologically-motivated analog VLSI circuits become  increasingly complex, implying more parameters, setting these parameters  by hand will become more cumbersome. Thus an automated parameter  setting method can be of great value [Fleischer 90]. Automated parameter  setting is an integral part of a goal-based engineering design methodology  in which circuits are constructed with parameters enabling a wide range  of behaviors, and are then "tuned" to the desired behaviors automatically.

Experimental results indicate that the  proposed system is sufficiently reliable for practical implementation.

Burst Synchronization without Frequency Locking in a Completely Solvable Neural Network Model

The dynamic behavior of a network model consisting of all-to-all excitatory  coupled binary neurons with global inhibition is studied analytically and  numerically. We prove that for random input signals, the output of the  network consists of synchronized bursts with apparently random intermis(cid:173) sions of noisy activity. Our results suggest that synchronous bursts can be  generated by a simple neuronal architecture which amplifies incoming coin(cid:173) cident signals. This synchronization process is accompanied by dampened  oscillations which, by themselves, however, do not play any constructive  role in this and can therefore be considered to be an epiphenomenon.

For a single half(cid:173) plane and the intersection of two half-planes, we show that the average mistake  rate depends on the maximum rate at which an adversary can modify the concept.  These theoretical predictions are verified with simulations of several learning  algorithms including back propagation.

Oscillatory Neural Fields for Globally Optimal Path Planning
Michael Lemmon
A neural network solution is proposed for solving path planning problems  faced by mobile robots. The proposed network is a two-dimensional sheet  of neurons forming a distributed representation of the robot's workspace.  Lateral interconnections between neurons are "cooperative", so that the  network exhibits oscillatory behaviour. These oscillations are used to gen(cid:173) erate solutions of Bellman's dynamic programming equation in the context  of path planning. Simulation experiments imply that these networks locate  global optimal paths even in the presence of substantial levels of circuit  nOlse.

Retinogeniculate Development: The Role of Competition and Correlated Retinal Activity
Ron Keesing, David Stork, Carla Shatz
During visual development, projections from retinal ganglion cells  (RGCs) to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in cat are refined to  produce ocular dominance layering and precise topographic mapping.  Normal development depends upon activity in RGCs, suggesting a key  role for activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Recent experiments on  prenatal retina show that during early development, "waves" of activity  pass across RGCs (Meister, et aI., 1991). We provide the first  simulations to demonstrate that such retinal waves, in conjunction with  Hebbian synaptic competition and early arrival of contralateral axons,  can account for observed patterns of retinogeniculate projections in  normal and experimentally-treated animals.

A Neural Net Model for Adaptive Control of Saccadic Accuracy by Primate Cerebellum and Brainstem
Paul Dean, John Mayhew, Pat Langdon
Accurate saccades require interaction between brainstem circuitry and the  cerebeJJum.  A model of this interaction is described, based on Kawato's  principle  of  feedback-error-Iearning.  In  the  model  a  part  of  the  brainstem  (the superior colliculus) acts as a simple feedback controJJer  with no knowledge of initial eye position, and provides an error signal  for the cerebeJJum to correct for eye-muscle nonIinearities.  This teaches  the cerebeJJum,  modelled as a CMAC, to adjust appropriately the gain  on the brainstem burst-generator's internal feedback loop and so alter the  size of burst sent to  the  motoneurons.  With  direction-only errors  the  system rapidly learns to make accurate horizontal eye movements from  any  starting position, and  adapts realistically to  subsequent simulated  eye-muscle weakening or displacement of the saccadic target.

Segmentation Circuits Using Constrained Optimization
John Harris
A novel segmentation  algorithm has  been  developed  utilizing an absolute(cid:173) value  smoothness  penalty  instead  of  the  more  common  quadratic  regu(cid:173) larizer.  This  functional  imposes  a  piece-wise  constant  constraint  on  the  segmented  data.  Since  the  minimized energy  is  guaranteed  to  be  convex,  there  are  no  problems  with  local  minima  and  no  complex  continuation  methods are  necessary  to find  the  unique  global  minimum.  By  interpret(cid:173) ing the minimized energy  as  the generalized  power  of a  nonlinear resistive  network,  a  continuous-time analog segmentation  circuit was  constructed.

Rule Induction through Integrated Symbolic and Subsymbolic Processing
Clayton McMillan, Michael C. Mozer, Paul Smolensky
We  describe a neural network, called RufeNet, that learns explicit, sym(cid:173) bolic  condition-action  rules  in  a  formal  string  manipulation  domain.  RuleNet  discovers  functional  categories  over  elements  of the  domain,  and,  at  various  points  during  learning,  extracts  rules  that  operate  on  these  categories.  The  rules  are  then  injected  back  into  RuleNet  and  training continues,  in  a  process called iterative projection.  By  incorpo(cid:173) rating rules in this way,  RuleNet exhibits enhanced learning and gener(cid:173) alization  performance  over  alternative  neural  net  approaches.  By  integrating symbolic  rule  learning  and  subsymbolic  category  learning,  RuleNet  has capabilities  that go beyond a  purely  symbolic system.  We  show  how  this  architecture  can be  applied to  the  problem  of case-role  assignment  in  natural  language  processing,  yielding a  novel  rule-based  solution.

A comparison between a neural network model for the formation of brain maps and experimental data
K. Obermayer, K. Schulten, G. G. Blasdel
Recently, high resolution images of the simultaneous representation of  orientation preference, orientation selectivity and ocular dominance have  been obtained for large areas in monkey striate cortex by optical imaging  [1-3]. These data allow for the first time a "local" as well as "global"  description of the spatial patterns and provide strong evidence for corre(cid:173) lations between orientation selectivity and ocular dominance.  A quantitative analysis reveals that these correlations arise when a five(cid:173) dimensional feature space (two dimensions for retinotopic space, one each  for orientation preference, orientation specificity, and ocular dominance) is  mapped into the two available dimensions of cortex while locally preserving  topology. These results provide strong evidence for the concept of topology  preserving maps which have been suggested as a basic design principle of  striate cortex [4-7].

A Connectionist Learning Approach to Analyzing Linguistic Stress
Prahlad Gupta, David Touretzky
We use connectionist modeling to develop an analysis of stress systems in terms  of ease  of learnability.  In traditional linguistic analyses,  learnability arguments  determine default parameter settings based on the feasibilty of logicall y deducing  correct settings from an initial state.  Our approach provides an empirical alter(cid:173) native to such arguments.  Based on perceptron learning experiments using data  from  nineteen  human  languages,  we  develop a  novel  characterization of stress  patterns in terms of six parameters.  These provide both a partial description of the  stress pattern itself and a prediction of its learnability, without invoking abstract  theoretical constructs  such  as  metrical  feet.  This  work  demonstrates  that ma(cid:173) chine learning methods can provide a fresh  approach to understanding linguistic  phenomena.

Stationarity of Synaptic Coupling Strength Between Neurons with Nonstationary Discharge Properties
Mark R. Sydorenko, Eric Young
Based on a general non-stationary point process model, we computed estimates of  the synaptic coupling strength (efficacy) as a function of time after stimulus onset  between an inhibitory interneuron and its target postsynaptic cell in the feline dorsal  cochlear nucleus. The data consist of spike trains from pairs of neurons responding  to brief tone bursts recorded in vivo. Our results suggest that the synaptic efficacy is  non-stationary. Further. synaptic efficacy is shown to be inversely and  approximately linearly related to average presynaptic spike rate. A second-order  analysis suggests that the latter result is not due to non-linear interactions. Synaptic  efficacy is less strongly correlated with postsynaptic rate and the correlation is not  consistent across neural pairs.

Dual Inhibitory Mechanisms for Definition of Receptive Field Characteristics in a Cat Striate Cortex
A. Bonds
In  single  cells  of the  cat  striate  cortex,  lateral  inhibition  across  orienta(cid:173) tion  and/or spatial frequency  is  found  to enhance  pre-existing  biases.  A  contrast-dependent but spatially non-selective inhibitory component is also  found.  Stimulation with  ascending  and  descending  contrasts  reveals  the  latter  as  a  response  hysteresis  that  is  sensitive,  powerful  and  rapid,  sug(cid:173) gesting that it is  active in day-to-day vision.  Both forms of inhibition are  not  recurrent  but  are  rather  network  properties.  These  findings  suggest  two  fundamental  inhibitory mechanisms:  a  global mechanism that limits  dynamic range  and  creates  spatial selectivity  through  thresholding  and a  local mechanism that specifically refines  spatial filter  properties.  Analysis  of burst  patterns in spike  trains demonstrates that these  two mechanisms  have  unique  physiological origins.

Statistical Reliability of a Blowfly Movement-Sensitive Neuron
Rob de Ruyter van Steveninck, William Bialek
We develop a model-independent method for characterizing the reliability  of neural responses to brief stimuli. This approach allows us to measure  the discriminability of similar stimuli, based on the real-time response of a  single neuron. Neurophysiological data were obtained from a movement(cid:173) sensitive neuron (HI) in the visual system of the blowfly Calliphom ery(cid:173) throcephala. Furthermore, recordings were made from blowfly photore(cid:173) ceptor cells to quantify the signal to noise ratios in the peripheral visual  system. As photoreceptors form the input to the visual system, the reli(cid:173) ability of their signals ultimately determines the reliability of any visual  discrimination task. For the case of movement detection, this limit can  be computed, and compared to the HI neuron's reliability. Under favor(cid:173) able conditions, the performance of the HI neuron closely approaches the  theoretical limit, which means that under these conditions the nervous  system adds little noise in the process of computing movement from the  correlations of signals in the photoreceptor array.

Feedforward networks composed of units which compute a sigmoidal func(cid:173) tion  of a  weighted  sum of their  inputs  have  been  much investigated.  We  tested  the  approximation  and  estimation  capabilities  of networks  using  functions  more  complex  than  sigmoids.  Three  classes  of functions  were  tested:  polynomials,  rational  functions,  and  flexible  Fourier  series.  Un(cid:173) like  sigmoids,  these  classes  can  fit  non-monotonic functions.  They  were  compared  on  three  problems:  prediction  of  Boston  housing  prices,  the  sunspot  count,  and  robot  arm inverse  dynamics.  The  complex units  at(cid:173) tained  clearly superior  performance  on  the  robot  arm  problem,  which  is  a  highly  non-monotonic,  pure  approximation problem.  On  the  noisy  and  only  mildly  nonlinear  Boston  housing  and  sunspot  problems,  differences  among the  complex units  were  revealed;  polynomials did poorly,  whereas  rationals and flexible  Fourier series  were  comparable to sigmoids.

Adaptive Elastic Models for Hand-Printed Character Recognition
Geoffrey E. Hinton, Christopher Williams, Michael D. Revow
Hand-printed digits can be modeled as splines that are governed by about  8 control points. For each known digit. the control points have preferred  ., home" locations, and deformations of the digit are generated by moving  the control points away from their home locations. Images of digits can be  produced by placing Gaussian ink generators uniformly along the spline.  Real images can be recognized by finding the digit model most likely to  have generated the data. For each digit model we use an elastic matching  algorithm to minimize an energy function that includes both the defor(cid:173) mation energy of the digit model and the log probability that the model  would generate the inked pixels in the image. The model with the lowest  total energy wins. If a uniform noise process is included in the model of  image generation, some of the inked pixels can be rejected as noise as a  digit model is fitting a poorly segmented image. The digit models learn  by modifying the home locations of the control points.

Towards Faster Stochastic Gradient Search
Christian Darken, John Moody
Stochastic gradient descent is a general algorithm which includes LMS,  on-line backpropagation, and adaptive k-means clustering as special cases.  The standard choices of the learning rate 1] (both adaptive and fixed func(cid:173) tions of time) often perform quite poorly. In contrast, our recently pro(cid:173) posed class of "search then converge" learning rate schedules (Darken and  Moody, 1990) display the theoretically optimal asymptotic convergence rate  and a superior ability to escape from poor local minima. However, the user  is responsible for setting a key parameter. We propose here a new method(cid:173) ology for creating the first completely automatic adaptive learning rates  which achieve the optimal rate of convergence.

Gradient Descent: Second Order Momentum and Saturating Error
Barak Pearlmutter
Batch gradient descent, ~w(t) = -7JdE/dw(t) , conver~es to a minimum  of quadratic form with a time constant no better than '4Amax/ Amin where  Amin and Amax are the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of the Hessian  matrix of E with respect to w.  It was recently shown that adding a  momentum term ~w(t) = -7JdE/dw(t) + Q'~w(t - 1) improves this to  ~ VAmax/ Amin, although only in the batch case. Here we show that second(cid:173) order momentum, ~w(t) = -7JdE/dw(t) + Q'~w(t -1) + (3~w(t - 2), can  lower this no further. We then regard gradient descent with momentum  as a dynamic system and explore a non quadratic error surface, showing  that saturation of the error accounts for a variety of effects observed in  simulations and justifies some popular heuristics.

Active Exploration in Dynamic Environments
Sebastian B. Thrun, Knut M√∂ller
\Vhenever an agent learns to control an unknown environment, two oppos(cid:173) ing principles have to be combined, namely: exploration (long-term opti(cid:173) mization) and exploitation (short-term optimization). Many real-valued  connectionist approaches to learning control realize exploration by ran(cid:173) domness in action selection. This might be disadvantageous when costs  are assigned to "negative experiences" . The basic idea presented in this  paper is to make an agent explore unknown regions in a more directed  manner. This is achieved by a so-called competence map, which is trained  to predict the controller's accuracy, and is used for guiding exploration.  Based on this, a bistable system enables smoothly switching attention  between two behaviors - exploration and exploitation - depending on ex(cid:173) pected costs and knowledge gain.  The appropriateness of this method is demonstrated by a simple robot  navigation task.

A Contrast Sensitive Silicon Retina with Reciprocal Synapses
Kwabena A. Boahen, Andreas Andreou
The goal of perception is to extract invariant properties of the underly(cid:173) ing world. By computing contrast at edges, the retina reduces incident  light intensities spanning twelve decades to a twentyfold variation. In one  stroke, it solves the dynamic range problem and extracts relative reflec(cid:173) tivity, bringing us a step closer to the goal. We have built a contrast(cid:173) sensitive silicon retina that models all major synaptic interactions in the  outer-plexiform layer of the vertebrate retina using current-mode CMOS  circuits: namely, reciprocal synapses between cones and horizontal cells,  which produce the antagonistic center/surround receptive field, and cone  and horizontal cell gap junctions, which determine its size. The chip has  90 x 92 pixels on a 6.8 x 6.9mm die in 2/lm n-well technology and is fully  functional.

Markov Random Fields Can Bridge Levels of Abstraction

Network  vision  systems  must  make  inferences  from  evidential  informa(cid:173) tion across levels of representational abstraction, from low level invariants,  through  intermediate scene  segments,  to  high  level  behaviorally  relevant  object  descriptions.

We  show  first  how  to  construct  an  MRF  functionally  equivalent  to  a  Hough  transform  parameter  network,  thus establishing a  principled  probabilistic basis for  visual networks.

In particular,  they  have a  well-defined  probabilistic  interpretation,  intrinsically  incorporate  feedback,  and  offer  richer  representations  and decision capabilities.

Information Measure Based Skeletonisation
Sowmya Ramachandran, Lorien Pratt
Automatic determination of proper neural network  topology by  trimming  over-sized  networks  is  an  important  area  of study,  which  has  previously  been  addressed  using  a  variety  of techniques.  In  this  paper,  we  present  Information  Measure  Based  Skeletonisation  (IMBS),  a  new  approach  to  this  problem where  superfluous  hidden  units  are  removed  based  on  their  information measure (1M).  This measure,  borrowed from decision  tree  in(cid:173) duction  techniques,  reflects  the  degree  to  which  the  hyperplane  formed  by  a  hidden  unit  discriminates  between  training  data  classes.  We  show  the results of applying IMBS  to three classification tasks and demonstrate  that it removes a  substantial number of hidden  units without significantly  affecting  network performance.

We propose and empirically evaluate a method for the extraction of expert(cid:173) comprehensible rules from trained neural networks. Our method operates in  the context of a three-step process for learning that uses rule-based domain  knowledge in combination with neural networks. Empirical tests using real(cid:173) worlds problems from molecular biology show that the rules our method extracts  from trained neural networks: closely reproduce the accuracy of the network  from which they came, are superior to the rules derived by a learning system that  directly refines symbolic rules, and are expert-comprehensible.

Competitive Anti-Hebbian Learning of Invariants

Although the detection  of invariant structure in  a given set  of input patterns is  vital  to  many  recognition  tasks,  connectionist  learning  rules  tend  to  focus  on  directions of high variance (principal components).  The prediction paradigm is  often used to  reconcile this dichotomy; here we suggest a more direct approach  to  invariant learning based  on  an  anti-Hebbian learning rule.  An  unsupervised  tWO-layer  network implementing this  method in a competitive setting learns  to  extract coherent depth information from random-dot stereograms.

Information Processing to Create Eye Movements
David Robinson
Because  eye  muscles  never  cocontract  and  do  not deal  with  external  loads,  one can write an equation that relates  motoneuron firing rate to  eye  position and  velocity  - a  very  uncommon  situation  in  the  CNS.  The semicircular canals  transduce head velocity in a linear manner by  using  a  high  background  discharge  rate,  imparting  linearity  to  the  premotor  circuits  that  generate  eye  movements.  This  has  allowed  deducing  some  of the  signal  processing  involved,  including  a  neural  network that integrates.  These  ideas  are  often  summarized  by block  diagrams.  Unfortunately,  they  are  of little  value  in  describing  the  behavior  of single  neurons  - a  fmding  supported  by  neural  network  models.
