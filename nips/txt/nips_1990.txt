Modeling Time Varying Systems Using Hidden Control Neural Architecture
Esther Levin
Multi-layered  neural  networks  have  recently  been  proposed  for  non(cid:173) linear  prediction  and  system  modeling.  Although  proven  successful  for  modeling  time  invariant nonlinear systems,  the  inability  of neural  networks  to  characterize  temporal  variability  has  so  far  been  an  obstacle  in  applying  them  to  complicated  non stationary  signals,  such  as  speech.  In  this  paper  we  present  a  network  architecture,  called  "Hidden  Control  Neural  Network"  (HCNN),  for  modeling  signals  generated  by  nonlinear  dynamical  systems  with  restricted  time  variability.  The approach  taken  here  is  to  allow  the  mapping  that  is  implemented  by  a  multi  layered  neural  network  to  change  with  time  as  a  function  of an  additional  control  input  signal.  This  network  is  trained  using  an  algorithm  that  is  based  on  "back-propagation"  and  segmentation  algorithms  for  estimating  the  unknown  control  together  with  the  network's  parameters.  The HCNN  approach  was  applied  to  several  tasks  including  modeling  of  time-varying  nonlinear  systems  and  speaker-independent  recognition  of  connected  digits,  yielding  a  word accuracy of 99.1 %.

Using Genetic Algorithms to Improve Pattern Classification Performance
Eric Chang, Richard P. Lippmann
Genetic  algorithms  were  used  to select  and  create  features  and  to select  reference  exemplar  patterns for  machine vision  and speech  pattern  classi(cid:173) fication  tasks.  For a  complex speech  recognition  task,  genetic  algorithms  required no more computation time than traditional approaches to feature  selection  but reduced  the number of input features  required  by a factor  of  five  (from 153 to 33 features).  On a difficult artificial machine-vision task,  genetic  algorithms were  able  to create  new features  (polynomial functions  of the original features)  which reduced  classification error rates from  19%  to  almost  0%.  Neural  net  and  k  nearest  neighbor  (KNN)  classifiers  were  unable to provide such low error rates using only the original features.  Ge(cid:173) netic algorithms were also used to reduce the number of reference exemplar  patterns for  a  KNN classifier.  On a  338 training pattern vowel-recognition  problem with  10  classes,  genetic  algorithms reduced  the number of stored  exemplars from 338 to 43 without significantly increasing classification er(cid:173) ror  rate.  In  all  applications,  genetic  algorithms  were  easy  to  apply  and  found  good  solutions  in  many fewer  trials  than would  be  required  by ex(cid:173) haustive search.  Run times were long, but not unreasonable.  These results  suggest  that genetic  algorithms  are  becoming practical for  pattern  classi(cid:173) fication  problems  as faster  serial  and  parallel computers  are  developed.

Generalization Dynamics in LMS Trained Linear Networks
Yves Chauvin
For a simple linear case, a mathematical analysis of the training and gener(cid:173) alization (validation)  performance of networks trained by gradient descent  on a Least Mean Square cost function is provided as a function of the learn(cid:173) ing parameters and of the statistics of the training data base.  The analysis  predicts  that generalization error dynamics  are very dependent  on  a  pri(cid:173) ori initial weights.  In particular, the generalization error might sometimes  weave within a computable range during extended training.  In some cases,  the analysis provides bounds on the optimal number of training cycles  for  minimal  validation error.  For a  speech  labeling  task,  predicted  weaving  effects  were qualitatively tested  and  observed  by computer simulations in  networks trained by the linear and non-linear back-propagation algorithm.

Oscillation Onset in Neural Delayed Feedback
Andr√© Longtin
This paper studies dynamical aspects of neural systems with delayed  neg(cid:173) ative  feedback  modelled  by  nonlinear  delay-differential  equations.  These  systems  undergo  a  Hopf bifurcation  from  a  stable  fixed  point  to  a  sta(cid:173) ble  limit  cycle  oscillation  as  certain  parameters  are  varied.  It is  shown  that  their  frequency  of oscillation  is  robust  to  parameter  variations  and  noisy  fluctuations,  a  property that  makes  these  systems  good  candidates  for  pacemakers.  The  onset  of oscillation  is  postponed  by  both  additive  and parametric noise in the sense that the state variable spends more time  near the fixed  point than it would  in  the absence of noise.  This is  also the  case  when  noise  affects  the  delayed  variable,  i.e.  when  the  system  has  a  faulty  memory.  Finally,  it  is  shown  that  a  distribution  of delays  (rather  than a  fixed  delay)  also  stabilizes  the fixed  point solution.

Relaxation Networks for Large Supervised Learning Problems
Joshua Alspector, Robert Allen, Anthony Jayakumar, Torsten Zeppenfeld, Ronny Meir
Feedback  connections  are  required  so  that  the  teacher  signal  on  the  output  neurons  can  modify  weights  during  supervised  learning.  Relaxation  methods  are  needed  for  learning  static  patterns  with  full-time  feedback  connections.  Feedback  network  learning  techniques  have  not  achieved  wide  popularity  because  of the  still greater  computational efficiency  of back-propagation.  We  show by simulation that relaxation networks of the kind we  are implementing in  VLSI  are  capable  of  learning  large  problems  just  like  back-propagation  networks.  A microchip incorporates deterministic mean-field theory learning as  well  as  stochastic  Boltzmann  learning.  A  multiple-chip  electronic  system  implementing  these  networks  will  make  high-speed  parallel  learning  in  them  feasible in the future.

We present a generic neural network architecture capable of con(cid:173) trolling non-linear plants. The network is composed of dynamic.  parallel, linear maps gated by non-linear switches. Using a recur(cid:173) rent form of the back-propagation algorithm, control is achieved  by optimizing the control gains and task-adapted switch parame(cid:173) ters. A mean quadratic cost function computed across a nominal  plant trajectory is minimized along with performance constraint  penalties. The approach is demonstrated for a control task con(cid:173) sisting of landing a commercial aircraft in difficult wind conditions.  We show that the network yields excellent performance while re(cid:173) maining within acceptable damping response constraints.

Closed-Form Inversion of Backpropagation Networks: Theory and Optimization Issues
Michael Rossen
We describe a closed-form technique for mapping the output of a trained  backpropagation network int.o input activity space. The mapping is an in(cid:173) verse mapping in the sense that, when the image of the mapping in input  activity space is propagat.ed forward through the normal network dynam(cid:173) ics, it reproduces the output used to generate that image. When more  than one such inverse mappings exist, our inverse ma.pping is special in  that it has no projection onto the nullspace of the activation flow opera(cid:173) tor for the entire network. An important by-product of our calculation,  when more than one invel'se mappings exist, is an orthogonal basis set of  a significant portion of the activation flow operator nullspace. This basis  set can be used to obtain an alternate inverse mapping that is optimized  for a particular rea.l-world application.

Dynamics of Generalization in Linear Perceptrons
Anders Krogh, John Hertz
We study the evolution of the generalization ability of a  simple linear per(cid:173) ceptron with N  inputs which learns to imitate a  "teacher perceptron".  The  system is  trained  on p  =  aN  binary  example  inputs  and  the  generaliza(cid:173) tion  ability measured by testing for  agreement with  the teacher on all 2N  possible  binary input  patterns.  The dynamics may  be solved  analytically  and  exhibits  a  phase  transition  from  imperfect  to  perfect  generalization  at  a  =  1.  Except  at  this  point  the  generalization  ability  approaches  its  asymptotic  value  exponentially,  with critical slowing  down near  the  tran(cid:173) sition;  the  relaxation  time  is  ex  (1  - y'a)-2.  Right  at  the  critical  point,  1  the  approach  to  perfect  generalization  follows  a  power  law  ex  t - '2.  In  the presence of noise,  the generalization ability is  degraded  by  an amount  ex  (va - 1)-1 just above a  =  1.

Translation  of prepositions  was  attempted  by  presenting  a  locative expression to a  network trained in one language to generate a  semantic representation; the semantic representation was  then presented  to the network trained in the other language to generate the appropriate  preposition.

This device exploits  on-chip photoreceptors and the natural filtering properties of resistive net(cid:173) works to implement a  scheme similar  to  and  motivated  by  the Difference  of Gaussians (DOG) operator proposed by Marr and Hildreth (1980).

In this paper, after some introductory remarks into the classification prob(cid:173) lem as considered in various research communities, and some discussions  concerning some of the reasons for ascertaining the performances of the  three chosen algorithms, viz., CART (Classification and Regression Tree),  C4.5 (one of the more recent versions of a popular induction tree tech(cid:173) nique known as ID3), and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), it is proposed  to compare the performances of these algorithms under two criteria: classi(cid:173) fication and generalisation. It is found that, in general, the MLP has better  classification and generalisation accuracies compared with the other two  algorithms.

ART2/BP architecture for adaptive estimation of dynamic processes
Einar S√∏rheim
The goal has been to construct a supervised artificial neural network that  learns incrementally an unknown mapping. As a result a network con(cid:173) sisting of a combination of ART2 and backpropagation is proposed and  is called an "ART2/BP" network. The ART2 network is used to build  and focus a supervised backpropagation network. The ART2/BP network  has the advantage of being able to dynamically expand itself in response  to input patterns containing new information. Simulation results show  that the ART2/BP network outperforms a classical maximum likelihood  method for the estimation of a discrete dynamic and nonlinear transfer  function.

Self-organization of Hebbian Synapses in Hippocampal Neurons
Thomas Brown, Zachary Mainen, Anthony Zador, Brenda Claiborne
We are exploring the significance of biological complexity for neuronal  computation.  Here we demonstrate that Hebbian synapses in realistical(cid:173) ly-modeled  hippocampal  pyramidal  cells  may  give  rise  to  two  novel  forms of self -organization in response to structured synaptic input.  First,  on the basis of the electrotonic relationships between synaptic contacts,  a cell may become tuned to a small subset of its input space.  Second, the  same mechanisms may produce  clusters of potentiated synapses across  the space of the dendrites.  The latter type of self-organization may be  functionally  significant in  the presence of nonlinear dendritic  conduc(cid:173) tances.

A Recurrent Neural Network for Word Identification from Continuous Phoneme Strings
Robert Allen, Candace Kamm
A  neural  network  architecture  was  designed  for  locating  word  boundaries  and  identifying  words  from  phoneme  sequences.  This  architecture  was  tested  in  three  sets  of  studies.  First,  a  highly  redundant  corpus  with  a  restricted  vocabulary was  generated and the network was trained with a limited number of  phonemic variations for the words  in the corpus.  Tests of network performance  on a transfer set yielded a very low error rate.  In a second study, a network was  trained  to  identify  words  from  expert  transcriptions  of speech.  On a  transfer  test,  error  rate  for  correct  simultaneous  identification  of  words  and  word  boundaries was  18%.  The third study used the output of a phoneme classifier as  the input to the word and  word boundary identification network.  The error rate  on a transfer test set was 49% for this task.  Overall, these studies provide a first  step at identifying words in connected discourse with a neural network.

Adjoint-Functions and Temporal Learning Algorithms in Neural Networks
N. Toomarian, J. Barhen
The development of learning algorithms is generally based upon the min(cid:173) imization of an energy function. It is a fundamental requirement to com(cid:173) pute the gradient of this energy function with respect to the various pa(cid:173) rameters of the neural architecture, e.g., synaptic weights, neural gain,etc.  In principle, this requires solving a system of nonlinear equations for each  parameter of the model, which is computationally very expensive. A new  methodology for neural learning of time-dependent nonlinear mappings is  presented. It exploits the concept of adjoint operators to enable a fast  global computation of the network's response to perturbations in all the  systems parameters. The importance of the time boundary conditions of  the adjoint functions is discussed. An algorithm is presented in which  the adjoint sensitivity equations are solved simultaneously (Le., forward  in time) along with the nonlinear dynamics of the neural networks. This  methodology makes real-time applications and hardware implementation  of temporal learning feasible.

Language Induction by Phase Transition in Dynamical Recognizers
Jordan Pollack
A higher order recurrent neural network architecture learns to recognize and  generate languages after being  "trained"  on categorized exemplars.  Studying  these  networks  from  the  perspective  of  dynamical  systems  yields  two  interesting  discoveries:  First,  a  longitudinal  examination  of  the  learning  process  illustrates  a  new  form  of mechanical  inference:  Induction  by  phase  transition.  A  small  weight  adjustment  causes  a  "bifurcation"  in  the  limit  behavior of the network. This phase transition corresponds to the onset of the  network's  capacity  for  generalizing  to  arbitrary-length  strings.  Second,  a  study of the  automata resulting  from  the  acquisition  of previously published  languages  indicates  that  while  the architecture  is  NOT  guaranteed  to  find  a  minimal  finite  automata  consistent  with  the  given  exemplars,  which  is  an  NP-Hard  problem,  the  architecture  does  appear capable  of generating  non(cid:173) regular languages by exploiting fractal and chaotic dynamics. I end the paper  with  a  hypothesis  relating  linguistic  generative  capacity  to  the  behavioral  regimes of non-linear dynamical systems.

Chaitin-Kolmogorov Complexity and Generalization in Neural Networks
Barak Pearlmutter, Ronald Rosenfeld
We  present  a  unified  framework  for  a  number  of different  ways  of failing  to  generalize  properly.  During  learning,  sources  of random  information  contaminate  the  network,  effectively  augmenting  the  training  data  with  random information. The complexity of the function computed is therefore  increased,  and generalization is degraded.  We analyze replicated networks,  in  which  a  number of identical networks are independently trained on  the  same data and their results averaged.  We conclude that replication almost  always results in a decrease in the expected complexity of the network, and  that  replication  therefore  increases  expected  generalization.  Simulations  confirming the effect  are  also presented.

A Reinforcement Learning Variant for Control Scheduling
Aloke Guha
We  present  an  algorithm  based  on  reinforcement  and  state  recurrence  learning  techniques  to  solve  control  scheduling  problems.  In  particular,  we  have  devised  a  simple  learning  scheme  called  "handicapped  learning",  in  which  the  weights  of the  associative  search  element  are  reinforced,  either  positively  or negatively,  such  that the  system  is forced  to  move  towards the  desired  setpoint  in  the  shortest possible  trajectory.  To  improve  the  learning  rate,  a  variable  reinforcement  scheme  is  employed:  negative  reinforcement  values are  varied depending  on  whether the failure  occurs in  handicapped or  normal  mode  of operation.  Furthermore,  to  realize  a  simulated  annealing  scheme  for  accelerated  learning,  if the  system  visits  the  same  failed  state  successively,  the  negative  reinforcement  value  is  increased.  In  examples  studied,  these  learning  schemes  have  demonstrated  high  learning  rates,  and  therefore may prove useful  for  in-situ learning.

Kohonen Networks and Clustering: Comparative Performance in Color Clustering
Wesley Snyder, Daniel Nissman, David Van den Bout, Griff Bilbro
The problem of color clustering is defined and shown to be a problem of  assigning a large number (hundreds of thousands) of 3-vectors to a  small number (256) of clusters. Finding those clusters in such a way that  they best represent a full color image using only 256 distinct colors is a  burdensome computational problem. In this paper, the problem is solved  using "classical" techniques -- k-means clustering, vector quantization  (which turns out to be the same thing in this application), competitive  learning, and Kohonen self-organizing feature maps. Quality of the  result is judged subjectively by how much the pseudo-color result  resembles the true color image, by RMS quantization error, and by run  time. The Kohonen map provides the best solution.

The main point of this paper is that stochastic neural networks have a  mathematical structure that corresponds quite closely with that of  quantum field theory. Neural network Liouvillians and Lagrangians  can be derived, just as can spin Hamiltonians and Lagrangians in QFf.  It remains to show the efficacy of such a description.

Phonetic Classification and Recognition Using the Multi-Layer Perceptron
Hong Leung, James Glass, Michael Phillips, Victor W. Zue
In this paper, we will describe several extensions to our earlier work, utiliz(cid:173) ing a segment-based approach. We will formulate our segmental framework  and report our study on the use of multi-layer perceptrons for detection  and classification of phonemes. We will also examine the outputs of the  network, and compare the network performance with other classifiers. Our  investigation is performed within a set of experiments that attempts to  recognize 38 vowels and consonants in American English independent of  speaker. When evaluated on the TIMIT database, our system achieves an  accuracy of 56%.

Learning Trajectory and Force Control of an Artificial Muscle Arm by Parallel-hierarchical Neural Network Model
Masazumi Katayama, Mitsuo Kawato
We propose a new parallel-hierarchical neural network model to enable motor  learning for simultaneous control of both trajectory and force. by integrating  Hogan's control method and our previous neural network control model using a  feedback-error-learning scheme. Furthermore. two hierarchical control laws  which apply to the model, are derived by using the Moore-Penrose pseudo(cid:173) inverse matrix. One is related to the minimum muscle-tension-change trajectory  and the other is related to the minimum motor-command-change trajectory. The  human arm is redundant at the dynamics level since joint torque is generated by  agonist and antagonist muscles. Therefore, acquisition of the inverse model is  an ill-posed problem. However. the combination of these control laws and  feedback-error-learning resolve the ill-posed problem. Finally. the efficiency of  the parallel-hierarchical neural network model is shown by learning experiments  using an artificial muscle arm and computer simulations.

Basis-Function Trees as a Generalization of Local Variable Selection Methods for Function Approximation
Terence Sanger
Local variable selection has proven to be a powerful technique for ap(cid:173) proximating functions in high-dimensional spaces. It is used in several  statistical methods, including CART, ID3, C4, MARS, and others (see the  bibliography for references to these algorithms). In this paper I present  a tree-structured network which is a generalization of these techniques.  The network provides a framework for understanding the behavior of such  algorithms and for modifying them to suit particular applications.

A Short-Term Memory Architecture for the Learning of Morphophonemic Rules
Michael Gasser, Chan-Do Lee
Despite its successes,  Rumelhart and McClelland's (1986)  well-known ap(cid:173) proach to the learning of morphophonemic rules  suffers from two deficien(cid:173) cies:  (1)  It performs  the  artificial  task  of associating  forms  with  forms  rather  than  perception  or  production.  (2)  It is  not  constrained  in  ways  that humans learners  are.  This paper describes  a  model which  addresses  both objections.  Using  a  simple recurrent  architecture  which  takes  both  forms  and  "meanings"  as  inputs,  the  model  learns  to  generate  verbs  in  one  or  another  "tense",  given  arbitrary  meanings,  and  to  recognize  the  tenses  of verbs.  Furthermore,  it fails  to learn  reversal  processes  unknown  in human language.

Associative Memory in a Network of `Biological' Neurons
Wulfram Gerstner
The Hopfield network (Hopfield,  1982,1984) provides a simple model of an  associative memory in  a neuronal structure.  This model, however, is based  on highly artificial assumptions, especially the use of formal-two state neu(cid:173) rons  (Hopfield,  1982) or graded-response  neurons  (Hopfield,  1984).  \Vhat  happens if we  replace  the formal neurons  by 'real' biological neurons?  \Ve  address  this question  in  two steps.  First, we  show  that a simple model of  a  neuron  can  capture  all  relevant features  of neuron  spiking,  i. e., a  wide  range of spiking frequencies  and a realistic distribution of interspike inter(cid:173) vals.  Second, we construct an associative memory by linking these neurons  together.  The analytical solution for  a  large  and fully  connected  network  shows that the  Hopfield solution  is  valid only for  neurons  with  a short re(cid:173) fractory  period.  If the refractory  period  is  longer  than  a  crit.ical  duration  ie,  the  solutions  are  qualitatively different.  The  associative  character  of  the solutions, however,  is  preserved.

Oriented Non-Radial Basis Functions for Image Coding and Analysis
Avijit Saha, Jim Christian, Dun-Sung Tang, Wu Chuan-Lin
We introduce oriented non-radial basis function networks (ONRBF)  as a generalization of Radial Basis Function networks (RBF)- wherein  the Euclidean distance metric in the exponent of the Gaussian is re(cid:173) placed by a more general polynomial. This permits the definition of  more general regions and in particular- hyper-ellipses with orienta(cid:173) tions. In the case of hyper-surface estimation this scheme requires a  smaller number of hidden units and alleviates the "curse of dimen(cid:173) sionality" associated kernel type approximators.In the case of an im(cid:173) age, the hidden units correspond to features in the image and the  parameters associated with each unit correspond to the rotation, scal(cid:173) ing and translation properties of that particular "feature". In the con(cid:173) text of the ONBF scheme, this means that an image can be  represented by a small number of features. Since, transformation of an  image by rotation, scaling and translation correspond to identical  transformations of the individual features, the ONBF scheme can be  used to considerable advantage for the purposes of image recognition  and analysis.

Evaluation of Adaptive Mixtures of Competing Experts
Steven Nowlan, Geoffrey E. Hinton
We  compare  the  performance  of the  modular  architecture,  composed  of  competing  expert  networks,  suggested  by  Jacobs,  Jordan,  Nowlan  and  Hinton  (1991)  to  the  performance  of a  single  back-propagation  network  on  a  complex,  but  low-dimensional,  vowel  recognition  task.  Simulations  reveal that this system is capable of uncovering interesting decompositions  in  a  complex  task.  The  type  of decomposition  is  strongly  influenced  by  the  nature  of the  input  to  the  gating  network  that  decides  which  expert  to  use  for  each  case.  The  modular  architecture  also exhibits consistently  better  generalization on many variations of the  task.

Spoken Letter Recognition

Through the use of neural network classifiers and careful feature selection,  we have achieved high-accuracy speaker-independent spoken letter recog(cid:173) nition. For isolated letters, a broad-category segmentation is performed  Location of segment boundaries allows us to measure features at specific  locations in the signal such as vowel onset, where important information  resides. Letter classification is performed with a feed-forward neural net(cid:173) work. Recognition accuracy on a test set of 30 speakers was 96%. Neu(cid:173) ral network classifiers are also used for pitch tracking and broad-category  segmentation of letter strings. Our research has been extended to recog(cid:173) nition of names spelled with pauses between the letters. When searching  a database of 50,000 names, we achieved 95% first choice name retrieval.  Work has begun on a continuous letter classifier which does frame-by-frame  phonetic classification of spoken letters.

Design and Implementation of a High Speed CMAC Neural Network Using Programmable CMOS Logic Cell Arrays
W. Miller, Brian Box, Erich Whitney, James Glynn
A high speed implementation of the CMAC neural network was designed  using dedicated CMOS logic. This technology was then used to implement  two general purpose CMAC associative memory boards for the VME bus.  Each board implements up to 8 independent CMAC networks with a total  of one million adjustable weights. Each CMAC network can be configured  to have from 1 to 512 integer inputs and from 1 to 8 integer outputs.  Response times for typical CMAC networks are well below 1 millisecond,  making the networks sufficiently fast for most robot control problems, and  many pattern recognition and signal processing problems.

Interaction Among Ocularity, Retinotopy and On-center/Off-center Pathways During Development
Shigeru Tanaka
The development of projections from the retinas to the cortex is  mathematically analyzed according to the previously proposed  thermodynamic formulation of the self-organization of neural networks.  Three types of submodality included in the visual afferent pathways are  assumed in two models: model (A), in which the ocularity and retinotopy  are considered separately, and model (B), in which on-center/off-center  pathways are considered in addition to ocularity and retinotopy. Model (A)  shows striped ocular dominance spatial patterns and, in ocular dominance  histograms, reveals a dip in the binocular bin. Model (B) displays  spatially modulated irregular patterns and shows single-peak behavior in  the histograms. When we compare the simulated results with the observed  results, it is evident that the ocular dominance spatial patterns and  histograms for models (A) and (B) agree very closely with those seen in  monkeys and cats.

Coherent oscillatory activity in large networks of biological or artifi(cid:173) cial neural units may be a useful mechanism for coding information  pertaining to a single perceptual object or for  detailing regularities  within  a  data set.  We  consider  the  dynamics  of a  large  array  of  simple  coupled  oscillators  under  a  variety  of connection  schemes.  Of particular  interest  is  the  rapid  and  robust  phase-locking  that  results  from  a  "sparse"  scheme  where  each  oscillator  is  strongly  coupled  to a  tiny,  randomly selected, subset of its neighbors.

Qualitative structure from motion

Exact structure from motion is an ill-posed computation and therefore  very sensitive to noise. In this work I describe how a qualitative shape  representation, based on the sign of the Gaussian curvature, can be com(cid:173) puted directly from motion disparities, without the computation of an  exact depth map or the directions of surface normals. I show that humans  can judge the curvature sense of three points undergoing 3D motion from  two, three and four views with success rate significantly above chance. A  simple RBF net has been trained to perform the same task.

Learning to See Rotation and Dilation with a Hebb Rule
Martin Sereno, Margaret Sereno
Previous work (M.I. Sereno, 1989; cf. M.E. Sereno, 1987) showed that a  feedforward network with area VI-like input-layer units and a Hebb rule  can develop area MT-like second layer units that solve the aperture  problem for pattern motion. The present study extends this earlier work  to more complex motions. Saito et al. (1986) showed that neurons with  large receptive fields in macaque visual area MST are sensitive to  different senses of rotation and dilation, irrespective of the receptive field  location of the movement singularity. A network with an MT-like  second layer was trained and tested on combinations of rotating, dilating,  and translating patterns. Third-layer units learn to detect specific senses  of rotation or dilation in a position-independent fashion, despite having  position-dependent direction selectivity within their receptive fields.

A Comparative Study of the Practical Characteristics of Neural Network and Conventional Pattern Classifiers
Kenney Ng, Richard P. Lippmann
Seven different pattern classifiers were implemented on a serial computer  and compared using artificial and speech recognition tasks. Two neural  network (radial basis function and high order polynomial GMDH network)  and five conventional classifiers (Gaussian mixture, linear tree, K nearest  neighbor, KD-tree, and condensed K nearest neighbor) were evaluated.  Classifiers were chosen to be representative of different approaches to pat(cid:173) tern classification and to complement and extend those evaluated in a  previous study (Lee and Lippmann, 1989). This and the previous study  both demonstrate that classification error rates can be equivalent across  different classifiers when they are powerful enough to form minimum er(cid:173) ror decision regions, when they are properly tuned, and when sufficient  training data is available. Practical characteristics such as training time,  classification time, and memory requirements, however, can differ by or(cid:173) ders of magnitude. These results suggest that the selection of a classifier  for a particular task should be guided not so much by small differences in  error rate, but by practical considerations concerning memory usage, com(cid:173) putational resources, ease of implementation, and restrictions on training  and classification times.

CAM Storage of Analog Patterns and Continuous Sequences with 3N2 Weights
Bill Baird, Frank Eeckman
A simple architecture and algorithm for analytically guaranteed associa(cid:173) tive memory storage of analog patterns, continuous sequences, and chaotic  attractors in the same network is described. A matrix inversion determines  network weights, given prototype patterns to be stored. There are N units  of capacity in an N node network with 3N 2 weights. It costs one unit per  static attractor, two per Fourier component of each sequence, and four per  chaotic attractor. There are no spurious attractors, and there is a Lia(cid:173) punov function in a special coordinate system which governs the approach  of transient states to stored trajectories. Unsupervised or supervised incre(cid:173) mental learning algorithms for pattern classification, such as competitive  learning or bootstrap Widrow-Hoff can easily be implemented. The archi(cid:173) tecture can be "folded" into a recurrent network with higher order weights  that can be used as a model of cortex that stores oscillatory and chaotic  attractors by a Hebb rule. Hierarchical sensory-motor control networks  may be constructed of interconnected "cortical patches" of these network  modules. Network performance is being investigated by application to the  problem of real time handwritten digit recognition.

We find  that without  a  proper  choice of a  norm for  the inputs,  RBFs have  poor  generalization  properties.  A simple global scaling of the input variables greatly improves  performance.  We suggest some efficient methods to approximate this dis(cid:173) tance  metric.

This work extends computational learning theory to situations in which concepts  vary over time, e.g., system identification of a time-varying plant.

Given  this framework and focusing on memory-based algorithms, we have derived  some PAC-style sample complexity results that determine, for example, when  tracking is feasible. We have also used a similar framework and focused on  incremental tracking algorithms for which we have derived some bounds on  the mistake or error rates for some specific concept classes.

Natural Dolphin Echo Recognition Using an Integrator Gateway Network

The dolphin  recognizes targets by emitting natural sonar signals and listening to the  echoes that return.

The integrator gateway  network combines information from multiple echoes to classify targets  with about 90% accuracy.

Compact EEPROM-based Weight Functions
A. Kramer, C. Sin, R. Chu, P. Ko
We are focusing on the development of a  highly compact neural net weight  function based on the use of EEPROM devices.  These devices have already  proven  useful  for  analog  weight storage,  but  existing  designs  rely  on  the  use  of conventional voltage multiplication as the weight function,  requiring  additional  transistors  per  synapse.  A  parasitic  capacitance  between  the  floating gate and the drain of the EEPROM structure leads to an unusual  J-V characteristic  which can  be used  to advantage in  designing a compact  synapse.  This  novel  behavior  is  well  characterized  by  a  model  we  have  developed.  A single-device circuit results in a  1-quadrant synapse function  which  is  nonlinear,  though  monotonic.  A  simple  extension  employing  2  EEPROMs  results  in  a  2  quadrant  function  which  is  much  more  linear.  This approach offers  the  potential for  more than a  ten-fold  increase  in  the  density of neural net  implementations.

Discovering Viewpoint-Invariant Relationships That Characterize Objects
Richard Zemel, Geoffrey E. Hinton
Using  an  unsupervised  learning  procedure,  a  network  is  trained on  an en(cid:173) semble of images of the same two-dimensional object at different positions,  orientations  and  sizes.  Each  half of  the  network  "sees"  one  fragment  of  the object, and  tries to produce  as  output a set of 4 parameters that have  high mutual information with the 4 parameters output by  the other half of  the network.  Given the ensemble of training patterns, the 4 parameters on  which the two halves of the network can agree are the position, orientation,  and  size  of the  whole  object,  or  some  recoding  of them.  After  training,  the network can reject  instances of other shapes by  using the fact  that the  predictions  made  by  its  two  halves  disagree.  If two  competing  networks  are trained on  an unlabelled mixture of images of two objects, they  cluster  the training cases on the basis of the objects' shapes,  independently of the  position, orientation, and size.

Transforming Neural-Net Output Levels to Probability Distributions
John Denker, Yann LeCun
(1)  The  outputs  of a  typical  multi-output  classification  network  do  not  satisfy the axioms of probability; probabilities should be positive and sum  to one.  This problem  can  be solved  by  treating  the trained  network  as  a  preprocessor that produces  a  feature  vector that can be further  processed,  for instance by classical statistical estimation techniques.  (2) We present a  method for computing the first two moments ofthe probability distribution  indicating the range of outputs that are  consistent  with the input and the  training  data.  It is  particularly  useful  to  combine  these  two  ideas:  we  implement the  ideas  of section  1 using  Parzen  windows,  where  the  shape  and relative size  of each  window  is  computed  using the ideas of section  2.  This  allows  us  to make  contact  between  important  theoretical ideas  (e.g.  the  ensemble  formalism)  and  practical  techniques  (e.g.  back-prop).  Our  results  also  shed  new  light  on  and  generalize  the  well-known  "soft max"  scheme.

Can neural networks do better than the Vapnik-Chervonenkis bounds?
David Cohn, Gerald Tesauro
\Ve describe a series of careful llumerical experiments which measure the  average generalization capability of neural networks trained on a variety of  simple functions. These experiments are designed to test whether average  generalization performance can surpass the worst-case bounds obtained  from formal learning theory using the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension  (Blumer et al., 1989). We indeed find that, in some cases, the average  generalization is significantly better than the VC bound: the approach to  perfect performance is exponential in the number of examples m, rather  than the 11m result of the bound. In other cases, we do find the 11m  behavior of the VC bound, and in these cases, the numerical prefactor is  closely related to prefactor contained in the bound.

Discovering Discrete Distributed Representations with Iterative Competitive Learning
Michael C. Mozer
Competitive learning is an unsupervised algorithm that classifies input pat(cid:173) terns into mutually exclusive clusters. In a neural net framework, each clus(cid:173) ter is represented by a processing unit that competes with others in a winner(cid:173) take-all pool for an input pattern. I present a simple extension to the algo(cid:173) rithm that allows it to construct discrete, distributed representations. Discrete  representations are useful because they are relatively easy to analyze and  their information content can readily be measured. Distributed representa(cid:173) tions are useful because they explicitly encode similarity. The basic idea is  to apply competitive learning iteratively to an input pattern, and after each  stage to subtract from the input pattern the component that was captured in  the representation at that stage. This component is simply the weight vector  of the winning unit of the competitive pool. The subtraction procedure forces  competitive pools at different stages to encode different aspects of the input.  The algorithm is essentially the same as a traditional data compression tech(cid:173) nique known as multistep vector quantization, although the neural net per(cid:173) spective suggests potentially powerful extensions to that approach.

Leaning by Combining Memorization and Gradient Descent
John Platt
We have created a radial basis function network that allocates a  new computational unit whenever an unusual pattern is presented  to the network. The network learns by allocating new units and  adjusting the parameters of existing units. If the network performs  poorly on a presented pattern, then a new unit is allocated which  memorizes the response to the presented pattern. If the network  performs well on a presented pattern, then the network parameters  are updated using standard LMS gradient descent. For predicting  the Mackey Glass chaotic time series, our network learns much  faster than do those using back-propagation and uses a comparable  number of synapses.

Harmonic grammar (Legendre,  et al., 1990) is a connectionist theory of lin(cid:173) guistic  well-formed ness  based on the assumption  that the well-formedness  of a  sentence  can  be  measured  by  the  harmony  (negative  energy)  of the  corresponding  connectionist  state.

This  work  presents  an  Attractor  Neural  Network  (ANN)  model  of Re(cid:173) call  and  Recognition.  It is  shown  that  an  ANN  model  can  qualitatively  account  for  a  wide  range  of experimental  psychological  data  pertaining  to  the  these  two  main  aspects  of memory  access.  Certain  psychological  phenomena  are  accounted  for,  including  the  effects  of list-length,  word(cid:173) frequency,  presentation  time,  context  shift,  and  aging.  Thereafter,  the  probabilities of successful  Recall  and  Recognition  are  estimated,  in  order  to  possibly enable further  quantitative examination of the model.

Training Knowledge-Based Neural Networks to Recognize Genes in DNA Sequences
Michiel Noordewier, Geoffrey Towell, Jude Shavlik
We describe the application of a hybrid symbolic/connectionist machine  learning algorithm to the task of recognizing important genetic sequences.  The symbolic portion of the KBANN system utilizes inference rules that  provide a roughly-correct method for recognizing a class of DNA sequences  known as eukaryotic splice-junctions. We then map this "domain theory"  into a neural network and provide training examples. Using the samples,  the neural network's learning algorithm adjusts the domain theory so that  it properly classifies these DNA sequences. Our procedure constitutes  a general method for incorporating preexisting knowledge into artificial  neural networks. We present an experiment in molecular genetics that  demonstrates the value of doing so.

ALCOVE: A Connectionist Model of Human Category Learning
John Kruschke
ALCOVE  is  a  connectionist  model  of human  category  learning  that  fits  a  broad spectrum of human learning data.  Its architecture is  based on well(cid:173) established  psychological  theory,  and  is  related  to  networks  using  radial  basis functions.  From the perspective of cognitive psychology,  ALCOVE can  be construed as a combination of exemplar-based representation and error(cid:173) driven  learning.  From the perspective of connectionism,  it can  be seen  as  incorporating constraints into back-propagation networks  appropriate for  modelling human learning.

Multi-Layer Perceptrons with B-Spline Receptive Field Functions
Stephen Lane, Marshall Flax, David Handelman, Jack Gelfand
Multi-layer perceptrons are often slow to learn nonlinear functions  with complex local structure due to the global nature of their function  approximations. It is shown that standard multi-layer perceptrons are  actually a special case of a more general network formulation that  incorporates B-splines into the node computations. This allows novel  spline network architectures to be developed that can combine the  generalization capabilities and scaling properties of global multi-layer  feedforward networks with the computational efficiency and learning  speed of local computational paradigms. Simulation results are  presented for the well known spiral problem of Weiland and of Lang  and Witbrock to show the effectiveness of the Spline Net approach.

Planning with an Adaptive World Model

We present a new connectionist planning method [TML90].  By interaction  with  an  unknown  environment,  a  world  model  is  progressively  construc(cid:173) ted  using  gradient  descent.  For  deriving  optimal actions  with  respect  to  future  reinforcement,  planning is  applied in two steps:  an experience  net(cid:173) work proposes a  plan which is subsequently optimized by gradient descent  with  a  chain of world  models,  so  that  an  optimal reinforcement  may be  obtained  when  it  is  actually  run.  The  appropriateness  of this  method  is  demonstrated by a  robotics  application and a  pole balancing task.

A Multiscale Adaptive Network Model of Motion Computation in Primates
H. Wang, Bimal Mathur, Christof Koch
We  demonstrate  a  multiscale  adaptive  network  model  of motion  computation in primate area MT. The model consists of two stages:  (l)  local velocities are measured across multiple spatio-temporal channels,  and (2) the optical flow  field  is computed by a  network of direction(cid:173) selective neurons  at multiple  spatial  resolutions.  This model  embeds  the computational efficiency of Multigrid algorithms within a parallel  network as well as adaptively  computes  the most reliable estimate of  the flow  field across different spatial scales. Our model neurons show  the same nonclassical receptive field properties as Allman's type I MT  neurons.  Since local velocities are measured across multiple channels,  various  channels  often  provide  conflicting  measurements  to  the  network. We have incorporated a  veto scheme for conflict resolution.  This mechanism provides a novel explanation for the spatial frequency  dependency of the psychophysical phenomenon called Motion Capture.

Feedback Synapse to Cone and Light Adaptation
Josef Skrzypek
Light  adaptation  (LA)  allows  cone  vIslOn  to  remain  functional  between  twilight  and  the  brightest  time  of day  even  though,  at  anyone  time,  their  intensity-response (I-R)  characteristic  is  limited  to  3  log  units of the  stimu(cid:173) lating  light.  One mechanism  underlying  LA, was localized  in  the outer seg(cid:173) ment of an isolated cone (1,2). We found that by adding annular illhmination,  an  I-R  characteristic  of a  cone  can  be  shifted  along  the  intensity  domain.  Neural network involving feedback  synapse from  horizontal cells to cones is  involved  to  be  in  register  with  ambient  light  level  of  the  periphery.  An  equivalent  electrical  circuit  with  three  different  transmembrane  channels  leakage,  photocurrent  and  feedback  was  used  to  model static  behavior of a  cone.  SPICE simulation showed  that interactions between feedback  synapse  and  the  light  sensitive  conductance  in  the  outer  segment  can  shift  the  I-R  curves along  the  intensity domain, provided  that phototransduction  mechan(cid:173) ism is not saturated during maximally hyperpolarized light response.

Direct memory access using two cues: Finding the intersection of sets in a connectionist model
Janet Wiles, Michael Humphreys, John Bain, Simon Dennis
For lack of alternative models, search and decision processes have provided the  dominant paradigm for human memory access using two or more cues, despite  evidence against search as an access process (Humphreys, Wiles & Bain, 1990).  We present an alternative process to search, based on calculating the intersection  of sets of targets activated by two or more cues. Two methods of computing  the intersection are presented, one using information about the possible targets,  the other constraining the cue-target strengths in the memory matrix. Analysis  using orthogonal vectors to represent the cues and targets demonstrates the  competence of both processes, and simulations using sparse distributed  representations demonstrate the performance of the latter process for tasks  involving 2 and 3 cues.

Flight Control in the Dragonfly: A Neurobiological Simulation
William Faller, Marvin Luttges
Neural network simulations of the dragonfly flight neurocontrol system  have  been  developed  to  understand  how  this  insect  uses  complex,  unsteady  aerodynamics.  The  simulation  networks  account  for  the  ganglionic  spatial  distribution  of  cells  as  well  as  the  physiologic  operating range and the stochastic cellular fIring history of each neuron.  In  addition  the  motor  neuron  firing  patterns,  "flight  command  sequences", were utilized. Simulation training was targeted against both  the  cellular  and  flight  motor  neuron  firing  patterns.  The  trained  networks  accurately  resynthesized  the  intraganglionic  cellular firing  patterns. These in  tum controlled the  motor neuron fIring patterns that  drive  wing  musculature  during  flight.  Such  networks  provide  both  neurobiological analysis tools and fIrst  generation controls for  the  use  of "unsteady" aerodynamics.

We present a large vocabulary, continuous speech recognition system based  on  Linked  Predictive  Neural  Networks  (LPNN's).  The system  uses  neu(cid:173) ral  networks  as  predictors  of speech  frames,  yielding  distortion  measures  which  are  used  by  the  One Stage DTW algorithm to perform  continuous  speech  recognition.  The system,  already  deployed  in  a  Speech  to Speech  Translation system, currently achieves 95%,  58%,  and 39% word accuracy  on  tasks  with  perplexity  5,  111,  and  402  respectively,  outperforming sev(cid:173) eral simple HMMs  that  we  tested.  We  also  found  that  the  accuracy  and  speed of the LPNN can be slightly improved by the judicious use of hidden  control  inputs.  We  conclude  by  discussing  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of the predictive approach.

When tested in a computational model of piriform cortex,  this selective suppression, applied during learning, enhances associative  memory performance.

We consider feed-forward neural networks with one non-linear hidden layer  and  linear  output units.  The transfer  function  in the hidden  layer  are  ei(cid:173) ther  bell-shaped  or sigmoid.  In the bell-shaped  case,  we  show  how  Bern(cid:173) stein polynomials on one hand and the theory of the heat equation on the  other  are  relevant  for  understanding the  properties  of the  corresponding  networks.  In  particular,  these  techniques  yield  simple proofs of universal  approximation properties, i.e.  of the fact that any reasonable function can  be approximated to any degree of precision by a linear combination of bell(cid:173) shaped functions.  In addition, in  this  framework  the  problem of learning  is equivalent to the problem of reversing the time course of a diffusion pro(cid:173) cess.  The  results  obtained in  the bell-shaped  case  can  then  be  applied  to  the case  of sigmoid  transfer functions  in the hidden layer,  yielding similar  universality  results.

Sex identification in animals has biological importance. Humans are good  at making this determination visually, but machines have not matched  this ability. A neural network was trained to discriminate sex in human  faces, and performed as well as humans on a set of 90 exemplars. Images  sampled at 30x30 were compressed using a 900x40x900 fully-connected  back-propagation network; activities of hidden units served as input to a  back-propagation "SexNet" trained to produce values of 1 for male and  o for female faces. The network's average error rate of 8.1% compared  favorably to humans, who averaged 11.6%. Some SexNet errors mimicked  those of humans.

The advantages of a  speech recognition system incor(cid:173) porating  both  MLPs  and  HMMs  are  the  best  discrimination  and  the  ability  to  incorporate  multiple  sources  of evidence  (features,  temporal context) without restrictive assumptions of distributions  or  statistical  independence.

Results  support  the  previously  reported  utility of MLP probability estimation for  continuous speech recog(cid:173) nition.

This srudy has demonstrated how artificial neural networks (ANNs) can  be used to characterize seismic sources using high-frequency regional  seismic data.

Overall, we have found that  ANNs have potential applications to seismic event characterization and  identification, beyond just as a feature classifier. In future studies, these  techniques should be applied to actual data of regional seismic events  recorded at the new regional seismic arrays. The results of this study  indicates that an ANN should be evaluated as part of an operational  seismic event identification system.

In salamander retina, the response of On-Off ganglion cells to a central  flash is reduced by movement in the receptive field surround.

The model shows that the four neuron circuit can  account for previously observed movement sensitive reductions in  ganglion cell sensitivity and allows visualization and prediction of the  spatio-temporal pattern of activity in change sensitive retinal cells.

By adding syllab(cid:173) ification circuitry to structure the model's perception of the input string, we are  able to handle these examples with only two derivational steps.

The task is short-range homing in the pres(cid:173) ence of obstacles. The robot receives no global information and assumes  no comprehensive world model. Instead the robot receives only sensory  information which is inherently limited. A connectionist architecture is  presented which incorporates a large amount of a priori knowledge in the  form of hard-wired networks, architectural constraints, and initial weights.  Instead of hard-wiring static potential fields from object models, myarchi(cid:173) tecture learns sensor-based potential fields, automatically adjusting them  to avoid local minima and to produce efficient homing trajectories. It does  this without object models using only sensory information. This research  demonstrates the use of a large modular architecture on a difficult task.

Neural  network  algorithms  have  proven  useful  for  recognition  of individ(cid:173) ual,  segmented  characters.  However,  their recognition  accuracy  has  been  limited by  the  accuracy  of the  underlying  segmentation  algorithm.  Con(cid:173) ventional,  rule-based  segmentation  algorithms  encounter  difficulty  if the  characters  are touching, broken,  or noisy.  The problem in these situations  is  that  often  one  cannot  properly  segment  a  character  until  it  is  recog(cid:173) nized yet  one cannot  properly recognize  a  character until it is  segmented.  We present here  a  neural network algorithm that simultaneously segments  and recognizes  in an  integrated  system.

We  demonstrate  this  ability with  overlapping  hand-printed  numerals.

Ken-ichi Iso, Takao Watanabe
The  Neural  Prediction  Model  is  the  speech  recognition  model  based  on  pattern  prediction  by  multilayer  perceptrons.  Its  effectiveness  was  con(cid:173) firmed  by  the  speaker-independent  digit  recognition  experiments.  This  paper  presents  an  improvement  in  the model  and  its  application  to  large  vocabulary speech recognition,  based on subword units.  The improvement  involves an introduction  of "backward  prediction,"  which further  improves  the  prediction  accuracy  of the  original  model  with  only  "forward  predic(cid:173) tion".  In  application of the model  to  speaker-dependent large vocabulary  speech recognition,  the demi-syllable unit is  used  as  a subword recognition  unit.  Experimental  results  indicated  a  95.2%  recognition  accuracy  for  a  5000  word  test  set  and  the  effectiveness  was  confirmed  for  the  proposed  model  improvement and  the demi-syllable subword units.

A Recurrent Neural Network Model of Velocity Storage in the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex
Thomas Anastasio
A three-layered neural  network model was used to  explore  the  organization of  the  vestibulo-ocular  reflex  (VOR).  The  dynamic  model  was  trained  using  recurrent back-propagation to produce compensatory, long duration eye muscle  motoneuron  outputs  in  response  to  short  duration  vestibular  afferent  head  velocity  inputs.  The  network  learned  to  produce  this  response  prolongation,  known  as  velocity  storage,  by  developing  complex,  lateral  inhibitory  interac(cid:173) tions among the interneurons.  These had the low baseline, long time constant,  rectified  and  skewed  responses  that  are  characteristic  of  real  VOR  inter(cid:173) neurons.  The  model  suggests  that  all  of these  features  are  interrelated  and  result from lateral inhibition.

The Devil and the Network: What Sparsity Implies to Robustness and Memory
Sanjay Biswas, Santosh Venkatesh
Robustness is a commonly bruited property of neural networks; in particu(cid:173) lar, a folk theorem in neural computation asserts that neural networks-in  contexts with large interconnectivity-continue to function efficiently, al(cid:173) beit with some degradation, in the presence of component damage or loss.  A second folk theorem in such contexts asserts that dense interconnectiv(cid:173) ity between neural elements is a sine qua non for the efficient usage of  resources. These premises are formally examined in this communication  in a setting that invokes the notion of the "devil" 1 in the network as an  agent that produces sparsity by snipping connections.

Connectionist Implementation of a Theory of Generalization
Roger Shepard, Sheila Kannappan
Empirically,  generalization between  a  training  and  a  test  stimulus  falls  off in  close approximation to  an  exponential decay  function  of distance between  the  two stimuli in the "stimulus space" obtained by multidimensional scaling.  Math(cid:173) ematically, this result is derivable from  the assumption that an  individual takes  the  training  stimulus  to  belong  to  a  "consequential"  region  that includes  that  stimulus but is  otherwise of unknown  location, size, and  shape in the stimulus  space (Shepard, 1987).  As the individual gains additional information about the  consequential region-by finding other stimuli to be consequential or nOl-the  theory  predicts  the shape  of the generalization  function  to  change  toward  the  function relating actual probability of the consequence to location in the stimulus  space.  This paper describes a natural connectionist implementation of the theory,  and illustrates how implications of the theory for generalization, discrimination,  and classification learning can be explored by connectionist simulation.

Discrete Affine Wavelet Transforms For Anaylsis And Synthesis Of Feedfoward Neural Networks
Y. Pati, P. Krishnaprasad
In this paper we show that discrete affine wavelet transforms can provide  a tool for the analysis and synthesis of standard feedforward neural net(cid:173) works. It is shown that wavelet frames for L2(IR) can be constructed based  upon sigmoids. The spatia-spectral localization property of wavelets can  be exploited in defining the topology and determining the weights of a  feedforward network. Training a network constructed using the synthe(cid:173) sis procedure described here involves minimization of a convex cost func(cid:173) tional and therefore avoids pitfalls inherent in standard backpropagation  algorithms. Extension of these methods to L2(IRN) is also discussed.

Convergence of a Neural Network Classifier
John Baras, Anthony LaVigna
In  this  paper,  we  prove  that  the  vectors  in  the  LVQ  learning  algorithm  converge.  We  do  this  by  showing  that  the  learning  algorithm  performs  stochastic  approximation.  Convergence  is  then  obtained  by  identifying  the  appropriate  conditions  on  the  learning  rate  and  on  the  underlying  statistics of the  classification  problem.  We  also  present  a  modification  to  the  learning algorithm which  we  argue  results  in  convergence  of the  LVQ  error to the Bayesian optimal error as  the appropriate parameters become  large.

Optimal Sampling of Natural Images: A Design Principle for the Visual System
William Bialek, Daniel Ruderman, A. Zee
We formulate the problem of optimizing the sampling of natural images  using an array of linear filters. Optimization of information capacity is  constrained by the noise levels of the individual channels and by a penalty  for the construction of long-range interconnections in the array. At low  signal-to-noise ratios the optimal filter characteristics correspond to bound  states of a Schrodinger equation in which the signal spectrum plays the  role of the potential. The resulting optimal filters are remarkably similar  to those observed in the mammalian visual cortex and the retinal ganglion  cells of lower vertebrates. The observed scale invariance of natural images  plays an essential role in this construction.

A competitive modular connectionist architecture
Robert Jacobs, Michael Jordan
We describe a multi-network, or modular, connectionist architecture that  captures that fact that many tasks have structure at a level of granularity  intermediate to that assumed by local and global function approximation  schemes. The main innovation of the architecture is that it combines  associative and competitive learning in order to learn task decompositions.  A task decomposition is discovered by forcing the networks comprising the  architecture to compete to learn the training patterns. As a result of the  competition, different networks learn different training patterns and, thus,  learn to partition the input space. The performance of the architecture on  a "what" and "where" vision task and on a multi-payload robotics task  are presented.

A Model of Distributed Sensorimotor Control in the Cockroach Escape Turn
R.D. Beer, G. Kacmarcik, R.E. Ritzmann, H.J. Chiel
In response to a puff of wind, the American cockroach turns away and runs.  The circuit underlying the initial turn of this escape response consists of  three populations of individually identifiable nerve cells and appears to em(cid:173) ploy distributed representations in its operation. We have reconstructed  several neuronal and behavioral properties of this system using simplified  neural network models and the backpropagation learning algorithm con(cid:173) strained by known structural characteristics of the circuitry. In order to  test and refine the model, we have also compared the model's responses to  various lesions with the insect's responses to similar lesions.

A VLSI Neural Network for Color Constancy
Andrew Moore, John Allman, Geoffrey Fox, Rodney Goodman
A system for color correction has been designed, built, and tested suc(cid:173) cessfully; the essential components are three custom chips built using sub(cid:173) threshold analog CMOS VLSI. The system, based on Land's Retinex the(cid:173) ory of color constancy, produces colors similar in many respects to those  produced by the visual system. Resistive grids implemented in analog  VLSI perform the smoothing operation central to the algorithm at video  rates. With the electronic system, the strengths and weaknesses of the  algorithm are explored.

Stereopsis by a Neural Network Which Learns the Constraints
Alireza Khotanzad, Ying-Wung Lee
This paper presents a neural network (NN) approach to the problem of  stereopsis. The correspondence problem (finding the correct matches  between the pixels of the epipolar lines of the stereo pair from amongst all  the possible matches) is posed as a non-iterative many-to-one mapping . A  two-layer feed forward NN architecture is developed to learn and code this  nonlinear and complex mapping using the back-propagation learning rule  and a training set. The important aspect of this technique is that none of  the typical constraints such as uniqueness and continuity are explicitly  imposed. All the applicable constraints are learned and internally coded  by the NN enabling it to be more flexible and more accurate than the  existing methods. The approach is successfully tested on several random(cid:173) dot stereograms. It is shown that the net can generalize its learned map(cid:173) ping to cases outside its training set. Advantages over the Marr-Poggio  Algorithm are discussed and it is shown that the NN performance is supe(cid:173) rIOr.

The Tempo 2 Algorithm: Adjusting Time-Delays By Supervised Learning
Ulrich Bodenhausen, Alex Waibel
In this work we describe a new method that adjusts time-delays and the widths of  time-windows in artificial neural networks automatically.  The input of the units  are weighted by a gaussian input-window over time which allows the learning  rules for the delays and widths to be derived in the same way as it is used for the  weights.  Our results on a phoneme classification task compare well with results  obtained with the TDNN by Waibel et al., which was manually optimized for the  same task.

Learning Theory and Experiments with Competitive Networks
Griff Bilbro, David van den Bout
We  apply  the  theory  of Tishby,  Levin,  and Sol1a  (TLS)  to two problems.  First  we analyze  an elementary problem for  which we find  the predictions  consistent  with  conventional  statistical  results.  Second  we  numerically  examine  the  more realistic  problem of training a  competitive net  to learn  a  probability  density  from  samples.  We  find  TLS  useful  for  predicting  average  training  behavior.

We describe a computational model of the development and regenera(cid:173) tion of specific eye-brain circuits. The model comprises a self-organiz(cid:173) ing map-forming network which uses local Hebb rules, constrained by  (genetically determined) molecular markers. Various simulations of  the development and regeneration of eye-brain maps in fish and frogs  are described, in particular successful simulations of experiments by  Schmidt-Cicerone-Easter; Meyer; and Y oon.

The Recurrent Cascade-Correlation Architecture
Scott Fahlman
Recurrent  Cascade-Correlation  CRCC)  is  a recurrent  version  of the  Cascade(cid:173) Correlation learning architecture of Fah I man and Lebiere [Fahlman, 1990].  RCC  can learn from examples to map a sequence of inputs into a desired sequence of  outputs.  New hidden units with recurrent connections are added to the network  as needed during training.  In effect, the network builds up a finite-state machine  tailored  specifically  for  the current problem.  RCC  retains  the  advantages  of  Cascade-Correlation:  fast learning, good generalization, automatic construction  of a near-minimal multi-layered network, and incremental training.

Sequential Adaptation of Radial Basis Function Neural Networks and its Application to Time-series Prediction
V. Kadirkamanathan, M. Niranjan, F. Fallside
We develop a sequential adaptation algorithm for radial basis function  (RBF) neural networks of Gaussian nodes, based on the method of succes(cid:173) sive F-Projections. This method makes use of each observation efficiently  in that the network mapping function so obtained is consistent with that  information and is also optimal in the least L 2-norm sense. The RBF  network with the F-Projections adaptation algorithm was used for pre(cid:173) dicting a chaotic time-series. We compare its performance to an adapta(cid:173) tion scheme based on the method of stochastic approximation, and show  that the F-Projections algorithm converges to the underlying model much  faster.
