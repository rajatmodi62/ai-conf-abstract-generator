Computational Differences between Asymmetrical and Symmetrical Networks
Zhaoping Li, Peter Dayan
Symmetrically connected  recurrent networks have recently been  used as models of a host of neural computations.  However, be(cid:173) cause of the separation between excitation and inhibition, biolog(cid:173) ical  neural networks  are  asymmetrical.  We  study characteristic  differences between asymmetrical networks and their symmetri(cid:173) cal  counterparts,  showing  that  they  have  dramatically  different  dynamical behavior and also how the differences can be exploited  for computational ends.  We  illustrate our results in the case of a  network that is a selective amplifier.

A Randomized Algorithm for Pairwise Clustering
Yoram Gdalyahu, Daphna Weinshall, Michael Werman
We present a stochastic clustering algorithm based on pairwise sim(cid:173) ilarity  of datapoints.  Our  method  extends  existing  deterministic  methods, including agglomerative algorithms, min-cut graph  algo(cid:173) rithms,  and  connected  components.  Thus  it  provides  a  common  framework for  all  these  methods.  Our  graph-based  method  differs  from  existing  stochastic  methods  which  are  based  on  analogy  to  physical  systems.  The  stochastic  nature  of our  method  makes  it  more  robust  against  noise,  including  accidental  edges  and  small  spurious clusters.  We demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm  using  an example with  3 spiraling bands and  a  lot of noise.

Risk Sensitive Reinforcement Learning
Ralph Neuneier, Oliver Mihatsch
A directed generative model for binary data using a  small number  of hidden  continuous  units  is  investigated.  A  clipping  nonlinear(cid:173) ity distinguishes the model from conventional principal components  analysis.  The relationships between the correlations of the underly(cid:173) ing continuous Gaussian variables  and the binary output variables  are utilized  to learn  the  appropriate weights  of the network.  The  advantages of this  approach are illustrated on a  translationally in(cid:173) variant binary distribution and on handwritten digit  images.

Convergence of the Wake-Sleep Algorithm
Shiro Ikeda, Shun-ichi Amari, Hiroyuki Nakahara
The W-S (Wake-Sleep) algorithm is a simple learning rule for the models  with hidden variables.  It is  shown that this algorithm can be applied to  a factor  analysis model  which is  a linear version  of the  Helmholtz ma(cid:173) chine.  But even for a factor analysis model,  the general convergence is  not proved theoretically.  In this article, we describe the geometrical un(cid:173) derstanding of the W-S  algorithm in contrast with the EM (Expectation(cid:173) Maximization) algorithm and the em algorithm.  As the result, we prove  the convergence of the W-S  algorithm for the factor analysis model.  We  also show the condition for the convergence in general models.

Learning from Dyadic Data
Thomas Hofmann, Jan Puzicha, Michael Jordan
Dyadzc  data  refers  to  a  domain  with  two  finite  sets  of objects  in  which  observations are  made for  dyads , i.e., pairs with one element  from  either  set.  This  type  of data  arises  naturally  in  many  ap(cid:173) plication  ranging  from  computational  linguistics  and  information  retrieval to preference  analysis and computer vision.  In this paper,  we  present  a  systematic,  domain-independent framework  of learn(cid:173) ing  from  dyadic  data by  statistical  mixture  models.  Our  approach  covers different models with fiat  and hierarchical latent class struc(cid:173) tures.  We  propose  an  annealed  version  of the  standard  EM  algo(cid:173) rithm for  model fitting  which  is  empirically evaluated  on  a  variety  of data sets from  different  domains.

Call-Based Fraud Detection in Mobile Communication Networks Using a Hierarchical Regime-Switching Model
Jaakko Hollm√©n, Volker Tresp
Fraud causes substantial losses to telecommunication carriers. Detec(cid:173) tion systems which automatically detect illegal use of the network can be  used to alleviate the problem. Previous approaches worked on features  derived from the call patterns of individual users. In this paper we present  a call-based detection system based on a hierarchical regime-switching  model. The detection problem is formulated as an inference problem on  the regime probabilities. Inference is implemented by applying the junc(cid:173) tion tree algorithm to the underlying graphical model. The dynamics are  learned from data using the EM algorithm and subsequent discriminative  training. The methods are assessed using fraud data from a real mobile  communication network.

Analyzing and Visualizing Single-Trial Event-Related Potentials
Tzyy-Ping Jung, Scott Makeig, Marissa Westerfield, Jeanne Townsend, Eric Courchesne, Terrence J. Sejnowski
Event-related  potentials (ERPs),  are portions  of electroencephalo(cid:173) graphic  (EEG)  recordings  that  are  both  time- and  phase-locked  to  experimental  events.  ERPs  are  usually  averaged  to  increase  their  signal/noise  ratio  relative  to  non-phase  locked  EEG  activ(cid:173) ity,  regardless  of the  fact  that  response  activity  in  single  epochs  may vary  widely  in  time course  and scalp distribution.  This study  applies a linear decomposition tool, Independent Component Anal(cid:173) ysis  (ICA)  [1],  to  multichannel single-trial  EEG  records  to  derive  spatial filters  that  decompose  single-trial  EEG epochs  into  a  sum  of temporally  independent  and spatially fixed  components  arising  from  distinct  or  overlapping  brain  or  extra-brain  networks.  Our  results  on  normal  and  autistic  subjects  show  that  ICA  can  sep(cid:173) arate  artifactual,  stimulus-locked,  response-locked,  and.  non-event  related  background  EEG  activities  into separate  components,  al(cid:173) lowing ( 1) removal of pervasive artifacts of all types from single-trial  EEG records,  and (2) identification of both stimulus- and response(cid:173) locked EEG components.  Second, this study proposes a new visual(cid:173) ization tool, the 'ERP image', for investigating variability in laten(cid:173) cies  and amplitudes of event-evoked responses  in spontaneous EEG  or  MEG  records.  We show  that sorting single-trial ERP epochs  in  order  of reaction  time  and  plotting  the  potentials  in  2-D  clearly  reveals  underlying  patterns  of response  variability  linked  to  per(cid:173) formance.  These  analysis  and  visualization  tools  appear  broadly  applicable to electrophyiological research  on both normal and clin(cid:173) ical  populations.

Learning Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Using an EM Algorithm
Zoubin Ghahramani, Sam Roweis
The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative pro(cid:173) cedure  for  maximum  likelihood  parameter  estimation  from  data  sets  with  missing  or  hidden  variables  [2].  It has  been  applied  to  system identification in linear stochastic state-space models,  where  the state variables are hidden from the observer and both the state  and  the  parameters  of  the  model  have  to  be  estimated  simulta(cid:173) neously  [9].  We  present  a  generalization  of the  EM  algorithm for  parameter estimation in  nonlinear dynamical systems.  The "expec(cid:173) tation" step makes use of Extended Kalman Smoothing to estimate  the state, while the  "maximization"  step re-estimates the parame(cid:173) ters using these uncertain state estimates. In general, the nonlinear  maximization step is difficult because it requires integrating out the  uncertainty  in  the states.  However,  if Gaussian  radial  basis  func(cid:173) tion  (RBF)  approximators  are  used  to  model  the  nonlinearities,  the integrals  become  tractable  and the  maximization step  can  be  solved  via systems of linear equations.

Replicator Equations, Maximal Cliques, and Graph Isomorphism
Marcello Pelillo
We  present  a  new  energy-minimization  framework  for  the  graph  isomorphism  problem  which  is  based  on  an  equivalent  maximum  clique formulation.  The approach is centered around a fundamental  result proved by  Motzkin and Straus in the mid-1960s, and recently  expanded in  various ways,  which  allows  us  to formulate the maxi(cid:173) mum clique problem in  terms of a standard quadratic program.  To  solve  the  program we  use  "replicator"  equations,  a  class  of simple  continuous- and discrete-time dynamical systems developed in var(cid:173) ious  branches  of theoretical  biology.  We  show  how,  despite  their  inability  to escape from  local  solutions,  they  nevertheless  provide  experimental results which are competitive with those obtained us(cid:173) ing more elaborate mean-field  annealing heuristics.

Orientation, Scale, and Discontinuity as Emergent Properties of Illusory Contour Shape
Karvel Thornber, Lance Williams
A  recent  neural  model  of  illusory  contour  formation  is  based  on  a  distribution  of natural  shapes  traced  by  particles  moving  with  constant speed in directions given by Brownian motions.  The input  to that model consists of pairs of position and direction constraints  and the  output  consists  of the  distribution  of contours joining all  such  pairs.  In general,  these contours will  not  be closed  and  their  distribution  will  not  be  scale-invariant.  In  this  paper,  we  show  how  to  compute  a  scale-invariant  distribution  of  closed  contours  given  position  constraints  alone  and  use  this  result  to  explain  a  well  known illusory contour effect.

A modular analogue neuro-chip set with  on-chip learning capability  is  developed  for  active  noise  canceling.  The  analogue  neuro-chip  set  incorporates  the  error  backpropagation  learning  rule  for  practical  applications,  and  allows  pin-to-pin  interconnections  for  multi-chip  boards.  The  developed  neuro-board  demonstrated  active  noise  canceling  without  any  digital  signal  processor.  Multi-path  fading  of  acoustic  channels,  random  noise,  and  nonlinear distortion  of the  loud  speaker  are  compensated  by  the  adaptive  learning  circuits  of  the  neuro-chips. Experimental  results  are  reported  for  cancellation  of car  noise in  real time.

Coordinate Transformation Learning of Hand Position Feedback Controller by Using Change of Position Error Norm
Eimei Oyama, Susumu Tachi
In  order  to  grasp  an  object,  we  need  to  solve  the  inverse  kine(cid:173) matics problem, i.e., the coordinate transformation from  the visual  coordinates  to the joint  angle  vector  coordinates  of the arm.  Al(cid:173) though  several models  of coordinate transformation learning have  been proposed, they suffer from  a number of drawbacks.  In human  motion  control,  the  learning  of the  hand  position  error  feedback  controller in the inverse kinematics solver is important.  This paper  proposes  a  novel  model  of the coordinate transformation  learning  of  the  human  visual  feedback  controller  that  uses  the  change  of  the joint  angle vector and the corresponding change of the square  of the  hand  position  error  norm.  The  feasibility  of the  proposed  model  is  illustrated using numerical simulations.

Multi-Electrode Spike Sorting by Clustering Transfer Functions
Dmitry Rinberg, Hanan Davidowitz, Naftali Tishby
A  new  paradigm  is  proposed  for  sorting  spikes  in  multi-electrode  data using ratios of transfer functions  between cells and electrodes.  It  is  assumed  that  for  every  cell  and  electrode  there  is  a  stable  linear  relation.  These are  dictated  by  the properties of the tissue,  the electrodes  and  their relative  geometries.  The main  advantage  of the method is that it is  insensitive to variations in the shape and  amplitude of a  spike.  Spike  sorting  is  carried  out  in  two  separate  steps.  First,  templates  describing  the statistics of each spike type  are generated by clustering transfer function  ratios then spikes are  detected  in  the  data  using  the  spike  statistics.  These  techniques  were  applied  to  data generated  in  the  escape  response  system  of  the cockroach.

Fisher Scoring and a Mixture of Modes Approach for Approximate Inference and Learning in Nonlinear State Space Models
Thomas Briegel, Volker Tresp
We  present Monte-Carlo generalized EM  equations for learning in  non(cid:173) linear state space models.  The difficulties lie in the Monte-Carlo E-step  which consists of sampling from  the posterior distribution of the hidden  variables given the observations. The new idea presented in this paper is  to generate samples from a Gaussian approximation to the true posterior  from  which it is easy to obtain independent samples.  The parameters  of  the Gaussian approximation are either derived from the extended Kalman  filter or the Fisher scoring algorithm. In case the posterior density is mul(cid:173) timodal  we propose to  approximate the posterior by  a sum of Gaussians  (mixture of modes approach).  We show that sampling from the approxi(cid:173) mate posterior densities obtained by the above algorithms leads to better  models  than  using  point estimates  for  the  hidden  states.  In  our exper(cid:173) iment,  the Fisher scoring algorithm obtained  a better approximation of  the posterior mode than the EKF. For a multimodal distribution, the mix(cid:173) ture of modes approach gave superior results.

Probabilistic Modeling for Face Orientation Discrimination: Learning from Labeled and Unlabeled Data
Shumeet Baluja
This paper presents probabilistic modeling methods to solve the problem of dis(cid:173) criminating between five facial  orientations with  very  little labeled data.  Three  models are explored. The first model maintains no inter-pixel dependencies, the  second model is capable of modeling a set of arbitrary pair-wise dependencies,  and the last model allows  dependencies  only  between  neighboring pixels. We  show that for all three of these models, the accuracy of the learned models can  be greatly improved by  augmenting a small number of labeled training images  with  a  large  set of unlabeled  images using  Expectation-Maximization.  This  is  important because it is often difficult to obtain image labels, while many unla(cid:173) beled images  are  readily  available.  Through  a  large  set  of empirical  tests,  we  examine the benefits  of unlabeled data  for  each  of the  models.  By  using only  two randomly selected labeled examples per class, we can discriminate between  the five  facial orientations with an accuracy of 94%; with six labeled examples,  we achieve an accuracy of 98%.

Boxlets: A Fast Convolution Algorithm for Signal Processing and Neural Networks
Patrice Simard, L√©on Bottou, Patrick Haffner, Yann LeCun
Signal  processing  and  pattern  recognition  algorithms make  exten(cid:173) sive  use  of convolution.  In  many cases, computational accuracy  is  not  as  important  as  computational  speed.  In  feature  extraction,  for  instance,  the  features  of interest  in  a  signal  are  usually  quite  distorted.  This form of noise justifies some level of quantization in  order  to  achieve  faster  feature  extraction .  Our  approach  consists  of approximating regions  of the  signal  with  low  degree  polynomi(cid:173) als,  and then differentiating the resulting signals in order to obtain  impulse functions  (or derivatives of impulse functions).  With this  representation,  convolution  becomes  extremely  simple and  can  be  implemented quite effectively.  The true  convolution can  be  recov(cid:173) ered  by  integrating  the  result  of  the  convolution.  This  method  yields  substantial speed  up  in feature  extraction  and is  applicable  to convolutional neural  networks.

Experimental Results on Learning Stochastic Memoryless Policies for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
John Williams, Satinder Singh
Partially Observable Markov Decision  Processes  (pO "MOPs)  constitute  an  important  class  of reinforcement  learning problems  which  present  unique theoretical and computational difficulties.  In  the absence of the  Markov property,  popular reinforcement  learning  algorithms  such  as  Q-Iearning  may  no  longer  be  effective,  and  memory-based  methods  which remove partial observability via state-estimation  are notoriously  expensive.  An alternative approach is  to seek a stochastic memoryless  policy  which  for  each  observation  of  the  environment  prescribes  a  probability  distribution  over  available  actions  that  maximizes  the  average  reward  per  timestep.  A  reinforcement  learning  algorithm  which  learns  a locally optimal  stochastic memoryless  policy has  been  proposed by Jaakkola,  Singh and Jordan,  but not empirically verified.  We present  a variation  of this  algorithm,  discuss  its  implementation,  and demonstrate its viability using four test problems.

Attentional Modulation of Human Pattern Discrimination Psychophysics Reproduced by a Quantitative Model

We  previously  proposed  a  quantitative model  of early  visual  pro(cid:173) cessing  in  primates,  based  on  non-linearly interacting visual filters  and statistically efficient  decision.  We  now  use  this model to inter(cid:173) pret  the observed  modulation of a  range of human psychophysical  thresholds  with  and  without  focal  visual  attention.  Our  model  - calibrated  by  an  automatic fitting  procedure  - simultaneously  re(cid:173) produces  thresholds for  four  classical  pattern discrimination tasks,  performed while attention was engaged by another concurrent task.  Our model then predicts that the seemingly complex improvements  of certain  thresholds,  which  we  observed  when  attention  was  fully  available for  the  discrimination  tasks,  can  best  be  explained  by  a  strengthening  of competition among early  visual filters.

Signal Detection in Noisy Weakly-Active Dendrites
Amit Manwani, Christof Koch
Here we derive measures quantifying the information loss of a synaptic  signal due to the presence of neuronal noise sources, as it electrotonically  propagates along a weakly-active dendrite. We model the dendrite as an  infinite linear cable, with noise sources distributed along its length.  The  noise sources we consider are thermal noise, channel noise arising from  the stochastic nature of voltage-dependent ionic channels (K+ and Na+)  and synaptic noise due to spontaneous background activity. We assess the  efficacy of information transfer using a signal detection paradigm where  the objective is to detect the presence/absence of a presynaptic spike from  the post-synaptic membrane voltage. This allows us to analytically assess  the role of each of these noise sources in  information transfer.  For our  choice  of parameters,  we find  that the  synaptic  noise  is  the  dominant  noise source which limits the maximum length over which information  be reliably transmitted.

But it can also be con(cid:173) sidered  as  a  natural  generalization of linear principal  component anal(cid:173) ysis.  This  gives  rise  to  the  question  how  to  use  nonlinear features  for  data compression, reconstruction, and de-noising, applications common  in  linear PCA.

We  present  a  split and  merge  EM  (SMEM)  algorithm to overcome the local  maximum problem in  parameter estimation of finite  mixture  models.  In the  case  of mixture  models,  non-global  maxima often  involve  having  too  many  components of a  mixture  model  in one part of the space and  too  few  in  an(cid:173) other, widely separated part of the space.  To escape from such configurations  we  repeatedly perform simultaneous split and merge operations using a  new  criterion  for  efficiently  selecting  the  split  and  merge  candidates.

Learning Lie Groups for Invariant Visual Perception

One  of the  most important problems  in  visual  perception is  that of visual  in(cid:173) variance:  how are objects perceived to be the same despite undergoing transfor(cid:173) mations such as translations, rotations or scaling?  In this paper, we describe a  Bayesian method for learning invariances based on Lie group theory.  We show  that previous approaches based on first-order Taylor series expansions of inputs  can be regarded as special cases of the Lie group approach, the latter being ca(cid:173) pable of handling in principle arbitrarily large transfonnations. Using a matrix(cid:173) exponential based generative model of images,  we derive an unsupervised al(cid:173) gorithm for learning Lie group operators from  input data containing infinites(cid:173) imal transfonnations.  The on-line unsupervised learning algorithm maximizes  the posterior probability of generating the training data.  We provide experimen(cid:173) tal results suggesting that the proposed method can learn Lie group operators for  handling reasonably large I-D translations and 2-D rotations.

Convergence Rates of Algorithms for Visual Search: Detecting Visual Contours

This  paper  formulates  the  problem  of  visual  search  as  Bayesian  inference  and  defines  a  Bayesian  ensemble  of  problem  instances .  In  particular,  we  address  the  problem  of  the  detection  of  visual  contours  in  noise/clutter  by  optimizing  a  global  criterion  which  combines  local  intensity  and  geometry  information.  We  analyze  the  convergence  rates  of  A * search  algorithms  using  results  from  information theory to bound  the  probability of rare  events  within  the Bayesian ensemble.  This analysis determines characteristics of  the  domain ,  which  we  call  order  parameters,  that  determine  the  convergence  rates.

Cluster  analysis  is  a  fundamental  principle  in  exploratory  data  analysis,  providing the user  with a  description  of the  group struc(cid:173) ture of given data.  A key  problem in  this context is the interpreta(cid:173) tion  and  visualization  of clustering  solutions  in  high- dimensional  or  abstract  data  spaces.  In  particular,  probabilistic  descriptions  of the  group structure,  essential  to  capture  inter-cluster  relation(cid:173) ships, are hardly assessable by simple inspection ofthe probabilistic  assignment  variables.

Modeling Surround Suppression in V1 Neurons with a Statistically Derived Normalization Model

We examine the statistics of natural monochromatic images decomposed 
using a multi-scale wavelet basis.  Although the coefficients of this rep(cid:173)
resentation are  nearly decorrelated,  they  exhibit important higher-order 
statistical dependencies that cannot be eliminated with purely linear pro(cid:173)
c~ssing. In particular, rectified coefficients corresponding to basis func(cid:173)
tions at neighboring spatial positions, orientations and scales are highly 
correlated.  A method of removing these dependencies is  to divide each 
coefficient by  a  weighted  combination of its  rectified  neighbors.  Sev(cid:173)

visual cortex are based on such "divisive normalization" computations, 
and thus our analysis provides a theoretical justification for these models. 
Perhaps more importantly, the statistical measurements explicitly specify 
the  weights that should be used in computing the normalization signal. 
We  demonstrate that this  weighting  is  qualitatively  consistent with  re(cid:173)
cent physiological experiments  that  characterize the  suppressive effect 
of stimuli presented outside of the classical receptive field.  Our obser(cid:173)
vations thus provide evidence for the hypothesis that early visual neural 
processing is well matched to these statistical properties of images.

Familiarity Discrimination of Radar Pulses
Eric Granger, Stephen Grossberg, Mark Rubin, William Streilein
The  ARTMAP-FD  neural  network  performs  both  identification  (placing  test  patterns in  classes  encountered during  training)  and  familiarity  discrimination  (judging  whether a  test  pattern belongs  to  any  of  the  classes  encountered  during  training).  The  perfor(cid:173) mance of ARTMAP-FD  is  tested  on  radar pulse  data obtained in  the field,  and compared to that of the nearest-neighbor-based NEN  algorithm and to a  k  > 1 extension of NEN.

Graphical Models for Recognizing Human Interactions
Nuria Oliver, Barbara Rosario, Alex Pentland
We describe  a real-time computer vision  and machine learning sys(cid:173) tem for  modeling and recognizing  human actions and interactions.  Two  different  domains  are  explored:  recognition  of  two-handed  motions in  the martial art  'Tai  Chi' , and multiple- person  interac(cid:173) tions  in a  visual  surveillance task.  Our system combines top-down  with  bottom-up information using  a  feedback  loop,  and  is  formu(cid:173) lated with  a  Bayesian  framework.  Two  different  graphical  models  (HMMs and Coupled HMMs) are used for modeling both individual  actions and multiple-agent interactions, and CHMMs are shown to  work  more efficiently  and  accurately  for  a  given  amount of train(cid:173) ing.  Finally,  to  overcome  the  limited  amounts  of training  data,  we  demonstrate  that  'synthetic  agents'  (Alife-style  agents)  can  be  used  to develop flexible  prior models of the person-to-person inter(cid:173) actions.

An Entropic Estimator for Structure Discovery
Matthew Brand
We  introduce  a  novel  framework  for  simultaneous  structure  and  parameter  learning  in  hidden-variable conditional probability models,  based on an  en tropic  prior and  a solution  for its maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator.  The MAP estimate minimizes uncertainty  in  all  respects:  cross-entropy  between  model  and  data;  entropy  of the  model ;  entropy  of  the  data's  descriptive  statistics.  Iterative  estimation  extinguishes  weakly  supported  parameters,  compressing and  sparsifying  the  model.  Trimming operators  accelerate  this  process  by  removing  excess  parameters  and,  unlike  most  pruning  schemes,  guarantee  an  increase  in  posterior  probability.  Entropic  estimation  takes  a  overcomplete  random  model  and simplifies  it,  inducing the  structure of relations  between  hidden  and  observed  variables.  Applied  to  hidden  Markov  models  (HMMs),  it  finds  a  concise  finite-state  machine  representing  the  hidden  structure  of a  signal.  We  entropically  model  music,  handwriting, and video time-series, and show that the resulting models are highly concise,  structured,  predictive,  and  interpretable:  Surviving  states  tend  to  be  highly  correlated  with meaningful partitions of the data, while surviving transitions provide a low-perplexity  model of the signal dynamics.

The Effect of Correlations on the Fisher Information of Population Codes
Hyoungsoo Yoon, Haim Sompolinsky
We  study  the  effect  of correlated  noise  on  the  accuracy  of popu(cid:173) lation  coding  using  a  model  of  a  population  of  neurons  that  are  broadly  tuned  to  an  angle  in  two-dimension.  The  fluctuations  in  the neuronal activity is  modeled  as  a  Gaussian noise with pairwise  correlations which decays exponentially with the difference between  the preferred orientations of the pair.  By calculating the Fisher in(cid:173) formation  of the  system,  we  show  that in  the biologically  relevant  regime of parameters positive correlations decrease the estimation  capability  of the  network  relative  to  the  uncorrelated  population.  Moreover strong positive  correlations  result  in  information  capac(cid:173) ity  which  saturates  to a  finite  value  as  the  number  of cells  in  the  population  grows.  In  contrast,  negative  correlations  substantially  increase the information capacity of the neuronal  population.

Spike-Based Compared to Rate-Based Hebbian Learning
Richard Kempter, Wulfram Gerstner, J. van Hemmen
A  correlation-based learning  rule  at the  spike  level  is  formulated,  mathematically analyzed, and compared to learning in a firing-rate  description.  A  differential  equation  for  the  learning  dynamics  is  derived  under the assumption  that the time scales of learning and  spiking  can  be  separated.  For  a  linear  Poissonian  neuron  model  which receives time-dependent stochastic input we show that spike  correlations on  a  millisecond time scale play  indeed  a  role.  Corre(cid:173) lations between input and output spikes tend to stabilize structure  formation,  provided  that  the  form  of  the  learning  window  is  in  accordance with Hebb's  principle.  Conditions for  an intrinsic nor(cid:173) malization of the average synaptic weight are discussed.

Contrast Adaptation in Simple Cells by Changing the Transmitter Release Probability
P√©ter Adorj√°n, Klaus Obermayer
The contrast response function (CRF) of many neurons in the primary vi(cid:173) sual  cortex saturates and shifts towards higher contrast values following  prolonged presentation of high contrast visual stimuli.  Using a recurrent  neural  network of excitatory spiking neurons with adapting synapses we  show  that both effects could  be  explained  by  a fast  and  a slow compo(cid:173) nent in the synaptic adaptation.  (i) Fast synaptic depression leads to sat(cid:173) uration  of the CRF and  phase  advance  in  the cortical  response to  high  contrast stimuli.  (ii) Slow adaptation of the synaptic transmitter release  probability is derived such that the mutual information between the input  and  the output of a cortical neuron  is  maximal.  This component-given  by  infomax learning rule-explains contrast adaptation of the averaged  membrane  potential  (DC  component)  as  well  as  the surprising experi(cid:173) mental  result,  that  the  stimulus  modulated component  (Fl  component)  of a cortical cell's membrane potential adapts only weakly. Based on our  results,  we propose a new  experiment to estimate the strength of the ef(cid:173) fective  excitatory  feedback  to  a  cortical  neuron,  and  we  also  suggest a  relatively  simple experimental  test to justify our hypothesized synaptic  mechanism for contrast adaptation.

Optimizing Correlation Algorithms for Hardware-Based Transient Classification
R. Edwards, Gert Cauwenberghs, Fernando Pineda
The perfonnance of dedicated VLSI neural processing hardware depends  critically  on  the  design  of the  implemented  algorithms.  We  have  pre(cid:173) viously  proposed an  algorithm  for  acoustic  transient classification  [1].  Having implemented and demonstrated this algorithm in a mixed-mode  architecture,  we  now  investigate  variants  on  the algorithm,  using  time  and frequency channel differencing, input and output nonnalization, and  schemes to binarize and train the template values, with the goal of achiev(cid:173) ing optimal classification perfonnance for the chosen hardware.

Information Maximization in Single Neurons
Martin Stemmler, Christof Koch
Information from  the  senses must be compressed into the  limited range  of firing  rates  generated  by  spiking  nerve  cells.  Optimal  compression  uses all firing rates equally often, implying that the nerve cell's response  matches  the  statistics  of naturally  occurring  stimuli.  Since  changing  the  voltage-dependent ionic  conductances  in  the  cell  membrane  alters  the  flow  of information,  an  unsupervised,  non-Hebbian,  developmental  learning  rule  is  derived  to  adapt  the  conductances  in  Hodgkin-Huxley  model  neurons.  By  maximizing  the  rate  of information  transmission,  each firing rate within the model neuron's limited dynamic range is  used  equally often .

Mechanisms of Generalization in Perceptual Learning
Zili Liu, Daphna Weinshall
The learning of many visual perceptual tasks has been shown to be  specific  to practiced stimuli,  while  new  stimuli  require re-Iearning  from  scratch.  Here  we  demonstrate  generalization  using  a  novel  paradigm in motion discrimination  where learning has been previ(cid:173) ously  shown  to  be  specific.  We  trained  subjects  to  discriminate  the  directions  of  moving  dots,  and  verified  the  previous  results  that learning does not transfer from the trained direction to a  new  one.  However,  by  tracking  the  subjects'  performance  across  time  in  the new  direction, we  found  that their rate of learning doubled.  Therefore, learning generalized in  a  task previously considered too  difficult  for  generalization.  We  also  replicated,  in  the  second  ex(cid:173) periment, transfer following  training with  "easy"  stimuli.  The specificity  of perceptual learning and  the  dichotomy  between  learning of "easy"  vs.  "difficult"  tasks were hypothesized to involve  different  learning  processes,  operating  at  different  visual  cortical  areas.  Here we show how to interpret these results in terms of signal  detection  theory.  With  the  assumption  of limited  computational  resources,  we  obtain  the  observed  phenomena  - direct  transfer  and change of learning rate - for increasing levels of task 'difficulty.  It  appears  that  human  generalization  concurs  with  the  expected  behavior of a  generic discrimination system.

Probabilistic Image Sensor Fusion
Ravi Sharma, Todd Leen, Misha Pavel
We  present  a  probabilistic  method  for  fusion  of images produced  by multiple sensors.  The approach is  based on  an image formation  model in which  the sensor images are  noisy, locally linear functions  of an  underlying,  true  scene.  A  Bayesian framework  then  provides  for  maximum likelihood or  maximum a  posteriori  estimates of the  true  scene  from  the sensor  images.  Maximum likelihood estimates  of  the  parameters  of  the  image  formation  model  involve  (local)  second order image statistics, and thus are related to local principal  component  analysis.  We  demonstrate  the  efficacy  of the  method  on images from  visible-band  and infrared sensors.

Example-Based Image Synthesis of Articulated Figures
Trevor Darrell
We  present a  method  for  learning complex appearance mappings.  such  as  occur  with  images  of articulated  objects.  Traditional  interpolation  networks  fail  on  this  case since appearance is  not necessarily  a smooth  function  nor a linear manifold for articulated objects.  We  define an  ap(cid:173) pearance mapping from examples by constructing a set of independently  smooth interpolation networks; these networks can cover overlapping re(cid:173) gions of parameter space.  A  set  growing  procedure is  used  to  find  ex(cid:173) ample  clusters  which  are  well-approximated  within  their  convex  hull;  interpolation then proceeds only within these sets of examples. With this  method physically valid  images are produced even in regions of param(cid:173) eter space where nearby examples have different appearances.  We show  results generating both simulated and real arm images.

Lazy  learning  is  a  memory-based  technique  that,  once  a  query  is  re(cid:173) ceived, extracts a prediction interpolating locally the neighboring exam(cid:173) ples of the query which are considered relevant according to  a distance  measure.  In  this paper we propose a data-driven method to  select on a  query-by-query basis the optimal number of neighbors to be considered  for  each  prediction.  As  an  efficient way  to  identify  and  validate  local  models, the  recursive least  squares  algorithm  is  introduced  in  the  con(cid:173) text  of local  approximation and lazy learning.  Furthermore,  beside the  winner-takes-all strategy for model selection, a local combination of the  most promising models is explored.  The method  proposed  is  tested  on  six different datasets and compared with a state-of-the-art approach.

Distributional Population Codes and Multiple Motion Models
Richard Zemel, Peter Dayan
Most theoretical and empirical studies of population codes make  the assumption that underlying neuronal activities is a unique and  unambiguous value of an encoded quantity. However, population  activities can contain additional information about such things as  multiple values of or uncertainty about the quantity. We have pre(cid:173) viously suggested a method to recover extra information by treat(cid:173) ing the activities  of the population of cells  as coding for  a com(cid:173) plete distribution over the coded quantity rather than just a single  value.  We  now  show how  this approach bears on psychophys(cid:173) ical and neurophysiological studies of population codes for mo(cid:173) tion direction in tasks involving transparent motion stimuli.  We  show that, unlike standard approaches, it is able to recover mul(cid:173) tiple motions from population responses, and also that its output  is consistent with both correct and erroneous human performance  on psychophysical tasks.

Sparse Code Shrinkage: Denoising by Nonlinear Maximum Likelihood Estimation
Aapo Hyv√§rinen, Patrik Hoyer, Erkki Oja
Sparse  coding  is  a  method  for  finding  a  representation  of data in  which  each  of the  components of the representation is  only  rarely  significantly  active.  Such  a  representation is  closely  related  to re(cid:173) dundancy reduction and independent component analysis,  and has  some  neurophysiological  plausibility.  In  this  paper,  we  show  how  sparse coding can be used for denoising.  Using maximum likelihood  estimation of nongaussian variables corrupted by gaussian noise, we  show  how  to  apply a  shrinkage nonlinearity on  the components  of  sparse coding so  as  to reduce noise.  Furthermore,  we  show  how  to  choose the optimal sparse coding basis for  denoising.  Our method  is  closely  related  to  the  method  of wavelet  shrinkage,  but  has  the  important benefit over wavelet methods that both the features and  the shrinkage parameters are estimated directly from  the data.

Controlling the Complexity of HMM Systems by Regularization
Christoph Neukirchen, Gerhard Rigoll
This paper introduces a method for regularization ofHMM systems that  avoids parameter overfitting caused by insufficient training data.  Regu(cid:173) larization is  done by augmenting the  EM  training method by a penalty  term  that  favors  simple  and  smooth HMM  systems.  The penalty  term  is  constructed as  a mixture model of negative exponential distributions  that is assumed to generate the state dependent emission probabilities of  the HMMs.  This new method is the successful transfer of a well known  regularization approach in neural networks to the HMM domain and can  be interpreted as a generalization of traditional state-tying for HMM sys(cid:173) tems.  The effect of regularization is demonstrated for continuous speech  recognition tasks by improving overfitted triphone models and by speaker  adaptation with limited training data.

We  report  here  a  new  and  improved a VLSI implementation that provides smooth optical  flow as well as global motion in a two dimensional visual field.  The com(cid:173) putation of optical flow  is  an ill-posed problem, which expresses itself as  the aperture problem.  However, the optical flow  can be estimated by the  use of regularization methods, in  which additional constraints are intro(cid:173) duced in  terms of a global energy functional that must be minimized . We  show how the algorithmic constraints of Hom and Schunck [2]  on com(cid:173) puting smooth optical flow can be mapped onto the physical constraints  of an equivalent electronic network.

Learning to Estimate Scenes from Images
William Freeman, Egon Pasztor
We  seek  the  scene  interpretation  that  best  explains  image  data.  For example,  we  may want to infer the projected velocities  (scene)  which  best  explain  two  consecutive  image  frames  (image).  From  synthetic data , we  model the relationship between image and scene  patches, and between a scene patch and neighboring scene patches.  Given' a  new  image,  we  propagate likelihoods in  a  Markov network  (ignoring  the  effect  of loops)  to  infer  the  underlying  scene.  This  yields  an  efficient  method  to form  low-level  scene  interpretations.  We  demonstrate the technique for  motion analysis  and estimating  high  resolution images from  low-resolution ones.

Facial Memory Is Kernel Density Estimation (Almost)
Matthew Dailey, Garrison Cottrell, Thomas Busey
We  compare the  ability  of three exemplar-based memory models,  each  using  three  different  face  stimulus  representations,  to  account  for  the  probability a human subject responded "old" in an old/new facial mem(cid:173) ory experiment.  The models are  1) the  Generalized Context Model, 2)  SimSample,  a  probabilistic  sampling  model,  and  3)  MMOM,  a  novel  model related to kernel density estimation that explicitly encodes stim(cid:173) ulus  distinctiveness.  The representations  are  1)  positions of stimuli  in  MDS "face space," 2) projections of test faces onto the  "eigenfaces" of  the study set, and 3) a representation based on response to a grid of Gabor  filter jets.  Of the 9 model/representation combinations, only the distinc(cid:173) tiveness model in  MDS  space predicts the observed "morph familiarity  inversion" effect, in  which the subjects'  false alarm rate for morphs be(cid:173) tween similar faces  is higher than their hit rate for many of the  studied  faces.  This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that human mem(cid:173) ory for faces is a kernel density estimation task, with the caveat that dis(cid:173) tinctive faces require larger kernels than do typical faces.

An Integrated Vision Sensor for the Computation of Optical Flow Singular Points
Charles Higgins, Christof Koch
A robust, integrative algorithm is presented for computing the position of  the focus  of expansion or axis of rotation (the singular point)  in optical  flow  fields  such  as  those  generated  by  self-motion.  Measurements  are  shown of a fully parallel CMOS analog VLSI motion sensor array which  computes the direction of local motion (sign of optical flow) at each pixel  and can directly implement this algorithm.  The flow  field  singular point  is  computed in real time  with a power consumption of less than 2 m W.  Computation of the singular point for  more general flow  fields  requires  measures of field  expansion and  rotation,  which  it  is  shown can also  be  computed in real-time hardware, again using only the sign of the optical  flow  field.  These measures, along with the location of the singular point,  provide robust real-time self-motion information for the visual guidance  of a moving platform such as a robot.

Learning a Hierarchical Belief Network of Independent Factor Analyzers
Hagai Attias
Many  belief  networks  have  been  proposed  that  are  composed  of  binary units.  However,  for  tasks such  as  object  and speech  recog(cid:173) nition  which  produce real-valued  data,  binary network models  are  usually inadequate.  Independent component analysis  (ICA)  learns  a  model  from  real  data,  but  the  descriptive  power  of this  model  is  severly  limited.  We  begin  by  describing the  independent  factor  analysis  (IFA)  technique,  which  overcomes some of the limitations  of ICA.  We  then  create  a  multilayer  network  by  cascading single(cid:173) layer  IFA  models.  At  each  level,  the  IFA  network  extracts  real(cid:173) valued  latent  variables  that  are  non-linear  functions  of the  input  data  with  a  highly  adaptive  functional  form,  resulting  in  a  hier(cid:173) archical  distributed  representation  of  these  data.  Whereas  exact  maximum-likelihood  learning of the network  is  intractable,  we  de(cid:173) rive an algorithm that maximizes a  lower  bound on the likelihood,  based on a  variational approach.

Maximum-Likelihood Continuity Mapping (MALCOM): An Alternative to HMMs
David Nix, John Hogden
We describe Maximum-Likelihood Continuity Mapping (MALCOM), an  alternative to  hidden Markov models (HMMs) for processing sequence  data such as speech.  While HMMs have a discrete "hidden" space con(cid:173) strained by  a fixed  finite-automaton architecture, MALCOM has a con(cid:173) tinuous hidden space-a continuity map-that is  constrained only  by  a  smoothness requirement on paths through the space.  MALCOM fits  into  the same probabilistic framework for speech recognition as  HMMs, but  it represents  a  more  realistic  model  of the  speech  production  process.  To  evaluate the extent to which MALCOM captures speech production  information, we  generated continuous speech continuity maps  for three  speakers  and  used  the  paths  through  them  to  predict measured  speech  articulator data.  The median  correlation  between  the MALCOM paths  obtained from  only the  speech  acoustics  and  articulator measurements  was 0.77 on an  independent test set not used  to train MALCOM or the  predictor.  This  unsupervised  model  achieved  correlations  over speak(cid:173) ers and articulators only 0.02 to 0.15 lower than those obtained using an  analogous supervised method which used articulatory measurements as  well as acoustics ..

Semiparametric Support Vector and Linear Programming Machines
Alex Smola, Thilo-Thomas Frie√ü, Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf
Semiparametric models  are  useful  tools  in the case  where  domain  knowledge exists about the function to be estimated or emphasis is  put onto understandability of the  model.  We  extend two learning  algorithms  - Support  Vector  machines  and  Linear  Programming  machines  to  this  case  and  give  experimental  results  for  SV  ma(cid:173) chines.

Regularizing AdaBoost
Gunnar R√§tsch, Takashi Onoda, Klaus R. M√ºller
Boosting methods  maximize  a  hard  classification  margin  and  are  known as powerful techniques that do not exhibit overfitting for low  noise  cases.  Also for noisy data boosting will  try to enforce a  hard  margin and thereby give  too much  weight  to outliers,  which  then  leads to the dilemma of non-smooth fits  and overfitting.  Therefore  we  propose three algorithms to allow for  soft margin classification  by introducing regularization with slack variables into the boosting  concept:  (1)  AdaBoostreg  and  regularized  versions  of  (2)  linear  and  (3)  quadratic programming AdaBoost.  Experiments show  the  usefulness of the proposed algorithms in comparison to another soft  margin classifier:  the support vector machine.

Graph Matching for Shape Retrieval
Benoit Huet, Andrew Cross, Edwin Hancock
We  propose a new in-sample cross validation based method (randomized  GACV) for choosing smoothing or bandwidth parameters that govern the  bias-variance or fit-complexity tradeoff in  'soft' classification.  Soft clas(cid:173) sification refers to  a  learning procedure which  estimates the probability  that an example with a given attribute vector is  in  class  1 vs  class O.  The  target  for  optimizing  the  the  tradeoff is  the  Kullback-Liebler distance  between  the  estimated  probability  distribution  and  the  'true'  probabil(cid:173) ity  distribution,  representing  knowledge of an  infinite  population.  The  method uses a randomized estimate of the trace of a Hessian and mimics  cross validation at the cost of a single relearning with perturbed outcome  data.

DTs: Dynamic Trees
Christopher Williams, Nicholas Adams
In  this  paper we  introduce a new  class of image models,  which  we  call  dynamic trees or  DTs.  A dynamic tree model specifies  a prior  over a  large number of trees, each one of which is  a tree-structured  belief  net  (TSBN).  Experiments  show  that  DTs  are  capable  of  generating images that are less blocky, and the models have better  translation  invariance properties  than  a  fixed,  "balanced"  TSBN.  We  also show that Simulated Annealing is effective at finding trees  which  have high  posterior probability.

Adding Constrained Discontinuities to Gaussian Process Models of Wind Fields
Dan Cornford, Ian Nabney, Christopher Williams
Gaussian Processes provide good prior models for  spatial data,  but can  be  too  smooth.  In  many  physical  situations  there  are  discontinuities  along bounding surfaces, for example fronts in near-surface wind fields.  We  describe  a  modelling  method  for  such  a  constrained  discontinuity  and demonstrate how to  infer the  model parameters in wind fields  with  MCMC sampling.

The Belief in TAP
Yoshiyuki Kabashima, David Saad
We  show  the  similarity  between  belief propagation  and  TAP,  for  decoding  corrupted  messages  encoded  by  Sourlas's  method.  The  latter is  a  special  case of the Gallager  error-correcting code, where  the code word comprises products of J{ bits selected randomly from  the original message.  We examine the efficacy of solutions obtained  by the two methods for various values of J{ and show that solutions  for  J{  2':  3  may  be  sensitive  to  the  choice  of initial  conditions  in  the  case  of unbiased patterns.  Good  approximations  are obtained  generally  for  J{ = 2  and  for  biased  patterns  in  the  case  of  J{ 2':  3,  especially when  Nishimori's  temperature is  being used.

Synergy and Redundancy among Brain Cells of Behaving Monkeys
Itay Gat, Naftali Tishby
Determining the relationship between  the activity of a single nerve  cell  to that of an entire  population is  a  fundamental question  that  bears  on  the  basic  neural  computation  paradigms.  In  this  paper  we  apply  an  information theoretic  approach  to  quantify  the  level  of cooperative  activity  among cells  in  a  behavioral  context.  It is  possible to discriminate between  synergetic  activity of the cells  vs .  redundant  activity, depending on the difference  between  the infor(cid:173) mation  they  provide  when  measured  jointly  and  the  information  they  provide independently.  We define  a synergy  value that is  pos(cid:173) itive in the first  case and negative in  the second  and show  that the  synergy value can be measured by detecting the behavioral mode of  the animal from  simultaneously recorded  activity of the  cells.  We  observe  that  among  cortical  cells  positive  synergy  can  be  found,  while cells  from the  basal ganglia, active during the same task, do  not  exhibit similar synergetic  activity.

Classification on Pairwise Proximity Data
Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich, Peter Bollmann-Sdorra, Klaus Obermayer
We  investigate the problem of learning a classification task on data  represented in terms of their pairwise proximities.  This representa(cid:173) tion does  not refer  to an explicit feature  representation of the data  items and  is  thus  more  general than the standard approach  of us(cid:173) ing Euclidean feature vectors,  from  which  pairwise proximities can  always  be  calculated.  Our  first  approach  is  based  on  a  combined  linear  embedding  and  classification  procedure  resulting  in  an  ex(cid:173) tension of the Optimal Hyperplane algorithm to pseudo-Euclidean  data.  As  an  alternative  we  present  another  approach  based  on  a  linear threshold model in the proximity values themselves, which is  optimized using Structural Risk Minimization.  We  show that prior  knowledge about the problem can be incorporated by the choice of  distance measures and examine different metrics W.r.t.  their gener(cid:173) alization.  Finally, the algorithms are successfully applied to protein  structure  data  and  to  data from  the  cat's  cerebral  cortex.  They  show  better performance than K-nearest-neighbor classification.

Using Analytic QP and Sparseness to Speed Training of Support Vector Machines
John Platt
Training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) requires the solution of a very  large quadratic programming (QP) problem.  This paper proposes an  al(cid:173) gorithm for training SVMs:  Sequential Minimal Optimization,  or SMO.  SMO breaks the large QP problem into a series of smallest possible QP  problems which  are  analytically  solvable.  Thus,  SMO does not require  a numerical QP library.  SMO's computation time is dominated by eval(cid:173) uation  of the  kernel,  hence  kernel  optimizations  substantially  quicken  SMO. For the MNIST database, SMO is  1.7 times as fast as PCG chunk(cid:173) ing;  while for  the  UCI Adult database  and  linear SVMs,  SMO can  be  1500 times faster than the PCG chunking algorithm.

Dynamically Adapting Kernels in Support Vector Machines
Nello Cristianini, Colin Campbell, John Shawe-Taylor
The kernel-parameter is one of the few  tunable parameters in  Sup(cid:173) port  Vector  machines,  controlling  the  complexity  of the  resulting  hypothesis.  Its  choice  amounts to model  selection  and  its  value  is  usually  found  by  means  of a  validation  set.  We  present  an  algo(cid:173) rithm which  can automatically perform  model  selection with little  additional computational cost and with no need of a validation set .  In  this  procedure  model  selection  and  learning  are  not  separate,  but  kernels  are  dynamically  adjusted  during  the  learning  process  to find  the kernel parameter which  provides the best possible upper  bound on  the  generalisation error.  Theoretical  results  motivating  the  approach  and  experimental  results  confirming  its  validity  are  presented.

Temporally Asymmetric Hebbian Learning, Spike liming and Neural Response Variability
L. Abbott, Sen Song
Recent experimental data indicate that the strengthening or weakening of  synaptic connections between neurons depends on  the relative timing of  pre- and postsynaptic action potentials. A Hebbian synaptic modification  rule based on these data leads to a stable state in which the excitatory and  inhibitory inputs to a neuron are balanced, producing an irregular pattern  of firing.  It  has  been  proposed  that  neurons  in  vivo  operate  in  such  a  mode.

Learning Mixture Hierarchies
Nuno Vasconcelos, Andrew Lippman
The hierarchical representation of data has various applications in do(cid:173) mains such as data mining, machine vision, or information retrieval. In  this paper we introduce an extension of the Expectation-Maximization  (EM) algorithm that learns mixture hierarchies in a computationally ef(cid:173) ficient manner. Efficiency is achieved by progressing in a bottom-up  fashion, i.e. by clustering the mixture components of a given level in the  hierarchy to obtain those of the level above. This cl ustering requires onl y  knowledge of the mixture parameters, there being no need to resort to  intermediate samples. In addition to practical applications, the algorithm  allows a new interpretation of EM that makes clear the relationship with  non-parametric kernel-based estimation methods, provides explicit con(cid:173) trol over the trade-off between the bias and variance of EM estimates, and  offers new insights about the behavior of deterministic annealing methods  commonly used with EM to escape local minima of the likelihood.

On the Optimality of Incremental Neural Network Algorithms
Ron Meir, Vitaly Maiorov
We  study the approximation of functions by  two-layer feedforward neu(cid:173) ral  networks,  focusing  on  incremental  algorithms  which  greedily  add  units,  estimating  single  unit  parameters  at  each  stage.  As  opposed  to  standard algorithms for fixed architectures, the optimization at each stage  is  performed over a small  number of parameters, mitigating many of the  difficult numerical problems inherent in  high-dimensional non-linear op(cid:173) timization.  We  establish  upper bounds on  the  error incurred by  the  al(cid:173) gorithm, when approximating functions from the  Sobolev class, thereby  extending previous results  which only provided rates of convergence for  functions in certain convex hulls of functional spaces. By comparing our  results to recently derived lower bounds,  we  show  that the greedy algo(cid:173) rithms  are  nearly  optimal.  Combined  with  estimation  error results  for  greedy algorithms, a strong case can be made for this type of approach.

Coding Time-Varying Signals Using Sparse, Shift-Invariant Representations
Michael Lewicki, Terrence J. Sejnowski
A common way to represent a time series is to divide it into short(cid:173) duration blocks,  each of which is  then represented by a set of basis  functions.  A limitation of this approach, however, is  that the tem(cid:173) poral alignment of the basis functions with the underlying structure  in the time series is arbitrary.  We present an algorithm for encoding  a time series that does not require blocking the data.  The algorithm  finds  an efficient  representation by inferring the best temporal po(cid:173) sitions  for  functions  in  a  kernel  basis.  These  can  have  arbitrary  temporal  extent  and  are  not  constrained  to  be  orthogonal.  This  allows the model to capture structure in the signal that may occur  at arbitrary temporal positions and preserves the relative temporal  structure of underlying events.  The model is shown to be equivalent  to a  very sparse and highly over complete basis.  Under this model,  the mapping from  the data to the representation is  nonlinear,  but  can  be  computed  efficiently.  This form  also  allows  the  use  of ex(cid:173) isting methods for  adapting the basis itself to data.  This approach  is  applied to speech data and results in a shift invariant, spike-like  representation that resembles coding in the cochlear nerve.

Evidence for a Forward Dynamics Model in Human Adaptive Motor Control
Nikhil Bhushan, Reza Shadmehr
Based  on  computational  principles,  the  concept  of  an  internal  model for  adaptive control has been divided  into a  forward  and an  inverse model.  However, there is as yet little evidence that learning  control by the eNS is through adaptation of one or the other.  Here  we  examine  two  adaptive control  architectures, one  based only on  the inverse model and other based on a combination of forward and  inverse  models.  We  then show that for  reaching movements of the  hand  in  novel  force  fields,  only  the  learning of the  forward  model  results  in  key  characteristics of performance  that match  the  kine(cid:173) matics of human subjects.  In  contrast, the adaptive control system  that relies only on the inverse model fails to produce the kinematic  patterns observed  in  the subjects,  despite the  fact  that it  is  more  stable.  Our results  provide evidence that learning control of novel  dynamics is  via formation of a  forward  model.

Restructuring Sparse High Dimensional Data for Effective Retrieval
Charles Isbell, Paul Viola
The task in text retrieval is to find  the subset of a collection of documents relevant  to  a user's  information request,  usually expressed as  a set of words.  Classically,  documents and queries are represented as  vectors of word counts.  In  its  simplest  form, relevance is  defined to be the dot product between a document and  a query  vector-a measure  of the  number of common  terms.  A  central  difficulty  in  text  retrieval  is  that  the  presence or absence  of a  word  is  not sufficient to  determine  relevance to a query. Linear dimensionality reduction has been proposed as a tech(cid:173) nique for extracting underlying structure from  the document collection.  In  some  domains  (such  as  vision)  dimensionality  reduction  reduces  computational com(cid:173) plexity.  In  text retrieval  it is  more often  used  to  improve retrieval  performance.  We  propose  an  alternative  and  novel  technique  that  produces  sparse  represen(cid:173) tations  constructed  from  sets  of highly-related  words.  Documents  and  queries  are  represented  by  their distance  to  these  sets,  and relevance  is  measured by  the  number of common clusters.  This technique significantly improves retrieval  per(cid:173) formance,  is  efficient  to  compute  and  shares  properties  with  the  optimal  linear  projection operator and the independent components of documents.

Classification in Non-Metric Spaces
Daphna Weinshall, David Jacobs, Yoram Gdalyahu
A  key question in vision  is  how to represent our knowledge  of previously  encountered objects to classify new ones.  The answer depends on how we  determine  the similarity  of two  objects.  Similarity  tells  us how  relevant  each previously seen object is in determining the category to which a new  object belongs.  Here a  dichotomy  emerges.  Complex notions  of similar(cid:173) ity  appear necessary for  cognitive models  and applications,  while  simple  notions of similarity  form a tractable basis for current computational ap(cid:173) proaches  to classification.  We  explore  the  nature of this dichotomy  and  why  it  calls  for  new  approaches  to  well-studied  problems  in  learning.  We  begin  this  process  by  demonstrating  new  computational  methods  for  supervised  learning  that  can  handle  complex  notions  of similarity.  (1)  We  discuss  how  to  implement  parametric  met.hods  that  represent  a  class  by  its  mean  when  using  non-metric  similarity  functions;  and  (2)  We review  non-parametric  methods  that we  have developed  using  near(cid:173) est  neighbor  classification  in  non-metric  spaces.  Point  (2) ,  and  some of  the  background  of our  work have been described  in  more detail  in  [8].

Approximate Learning of Dynamic Models
Xavier Boyen, Daphne Koller
Inference is a key  component in  learning probabilistic models from par(cid:173) tially  observable  data.  When  learning  temporal  models,  each  of the  many  inference phases requires a  traversal  over an  entire long data se(cid:173) quence;  furthermore,  the  data structures manipulated are exponentially  large, making this process computationally expensive.  In [2], we describe  an approximate inference algorithm for monitoring stochastic processes,  and prove bounds on its approximation error.  In this paper, we apply this  algorithm as an approximate forward propagation step in an EM algorithm  for learning temporal Bayesian networks.  We provide a related approxi(cid:173) mation for the backward step, and prove error bounds for the  combined  algorithm.  We  show empirically that,  for a real-life domain,  EM  using  our inference algorithm  is  much  faster  than  EM  using exact inference,  with almost no degradation in quality of the learned model.  We  extend  our analysis  to  the  online learning  task,  showing a  bound  on  the  error  resulting  from  restricting  attention  to  a  small  window  of observations.  We  present an  online EM  learning algorithm for  dynamic systems,  and  show that it learns much faster than standard offline EM.

Independent Component Analysis of Intracellular Calcium Spike Data
Klaus Prank, Julia B√∂rger, Alexander von zur M√ºhlen, Georg Brabant, Christof Sch√∂fl
Calcium (Ca2+)is an ubiquitous intracellular messenger which reg(cid:173) ulates cellular processes, such as secretion, contraction, and cell  proliferation. A number of different cell types respond to hormonal  stimuli with periodic oscillations of the intracellular free calcium  concentration ([Ca2+]i). These Ca2+ signals are often organized  in complex temporal and spatial patterns even under conditions  of sustained stimulation. Here we study the spatio-temporal as(cid:173) pects of intracellular calcium ([Ca 2+]i) oscillations in clonal J3-cells  (hamster insulin secreting cells, HIT) under pharmacological stim(cid:173) ulation (Schofi et al., 1996). We use a novel fast fixed-point al(cid:173) gorithm (Hyvarinen and Oja, 1997) for Independent Component  Analysis (ICA) to blind source separation of the spatio-temporal  dynamics of [Ca2+]i in a HIT-cell. Using this approach we find two  significant independent components out of five differently mixed in(cid:173) put signals: one [Ca2+]i signal with a mean oscillatory period of  68s and a high frequency signal with a broadband power spectrum  with considerable spectral density. This results is in good agree(cid:173) ment with a study on high-frequency [Ca2+]j oscillations (Palus  et al., 1998) Further theoretical and experimental studies have to  be performed to resolve the question on the functional impact of  intracellular signaling of these independent [Ca2+]i signals.

A Model for Associative Multiplication

Despite the fact that mental arithmetic is  based on only a few  hun(cid:173) dred basic facts  and  some simple  algorithms, humans have a  diffi(cid:173) cult time  mastering the subject,  and  even  experienced  individuals  make  mistakes.  Associative  multiplication,  the  process  of doing  multiplication  by  memory  without the  use  of rules  or algorithms,  is  especially  problematic.  Humans  exhibit  certain  characteristic  phenomena in  performing associative  multiplications,  both in  the  type of error and  in  the error frequency.  We  propose a  model  for  the  process  of associative  multiplication,  and  compare  its  perfor(cid:173) mance  in  both  these  phenomena  with  data from  normal  humans  and from  the model proposed  by  Anderson  et al (1994).

The new method is based on a framework developed by  Kivinen and Warmuth for supervised on-line learning. In contrast to gra(cid:173) dient descent and EM, which estimate the mixture's covariance matrices,  the proposed method estimates the inverses  of the covariance matrices.  Furthennore, the new parameter estimation procedure can  be applied in  both on-line and  batch settings.  We show experimentally that it is typi(cid:173) cally faster than EM, and usually requires about half as  many  iterations  as EM.

Learning Macro-Actions in Reinforcement Learning
Jette Randlov
We present a method for automatically constructing macro-actions from  scratch from primitive actions during the reinforcement learning process.  The  overall  idea is  to reinforce  the  tendency  to  perform action b after  action a  if such  a  pattern  of actions  has  been rewarded.  We  test  the  method on a bicycle task, the car-on-the-hill task, the race-track task and  some grid-world tasks.  For the  bicycle and race-track tasks  the use  of  macro-actions approximately halves the learning time, while for one of  the grid-world tasks  the learning time is  reduced by a  factor of 5.  The  method did not work for the car-on-the-hill task for reasons we discuss  in the conclusion.

Computer animation through the numerical simulation of physics-based  graphics  models offers  unsurpassed realism,  but  it can be computation(cid:173) ally demanding. This paper demonstrates the possibility of replacing the  numerical simulation of nontrivial dynamic  models  with  a dramatically  more  efficient  "NeuroAnimator"  that  exploits  neural  networks.  Neu(cid:173) roAnimators  are  automatically  trained  off-line  to  emulate  physical  dy(cid:173) namics through  the observation  of physics-based models in  action.

Improved Switching among Temporally Abstract Actions

In robotics and other control applications it is commonplace to have a pre(cid:173) existing  set  of controllers  for  solving  subtasks,  perhaps  hand-crafted  or  previously learned or planned, and still face  a difficult problem of how to  choose and switch among the controllers to solve an overall task as well as  possible.  In this paper we present a framework based on Markov decision  processes and semi-Markov decision processes for phrasing this problem,  a basic theorem regarding the improvement in performance that can be ob(cid:173) tained by switching flexibly between given controllers, and example appli(cid:173) cations of the theorem.  In particular, we show how an  agent can plan with  these high-level controllers and then use the results of such planning to find  an even better plan, by modifying the existing controllers, with negligible  additional cost and no re-planning. In one of our examples, the complexity  of the problem is  reduced from  24 billion state-action pairs to  less than a  million state-controller pairs.

A Polygonal Line Algorithm for Constructing Principal Curves
Bal√°zs K√©gl, Adam Krzyzak, Tam√°s Linder, Kenneth Zeger
Principal curves have  been  defined  as  "self consistent" smooth  curves  which pass through the "middle" of a d-dimensional probability distri(cid:173) bution or data cloud.  Recently, we  [1]  have offered a new approach by  defining principal curves as continuous curves of a  given length which  minimize the expected squared distance between the curve and points of  the space randomly chosen according to  a given distribution.  The new  definition made it possible to carry out a theoretical analysis of learning  principal curves from training data.  In this paper we propose a practical  construction based on the new definition.  Simulation results demonstrate  that the new algorithm compares favorably with previous methods both  in terms of performance and computational complexity.

Neuronal Regulation Implements Efficient Synaptic Pruning
Gal Chechik, Isaac Meilijson, Eytan Ruppin
Human and animal studies show  that mammalian brain undergoes  massive synaptic pruning during childhood , removing about half of  the  synapses  until  puberty.  We  have  previously  shown  that main(cid:173) taining network  memory performance  while  synapses  are  deleted,  requires  that  synapses  are  properly  modified  and  pruned,  remov(cid:173) ing the weaker synapses.  We  now show that neuronal regulation , a  mechanism recently  observed  to maintain the average neuronal in(cid:173) put field , results in weight-dependent synaptic modification . Under  the  correct  range  of the  degradation  dimension  and  synaptic  up(cid:173) per  bound,  neuronal  regulation  removes  the  weaker  synapses  and  judiciously  modifies  the  remaining  synapses .  It implements  near  optimal synaptic modification, and  maintains the  memory perfor(cid:173) mance  of a  network  undergoing  massive  synaptic  pruning.  Thus ,  this  paper shows  that  in  addition to the  known effects  of Hebbian  changes,  neuronal  regulation  may  play  an  important  role  in  the  self-organization of brain networks during development.

Finite-Sample Convergence Rates for Q-Learning and Indirect Algorithms
Michael Kearns, Satinder Singh
In  this  paper,  we  address  two  issues  of long-standing  interest  in  the  re(cid:173) inforcement  learning  literature.  First,  what  kinds  of performance  guar(cid:173) antees  can  be  made  for  Q-learning  after  only  a  finite  number  of actions?  Second,  what  quantitative  comparisons  can  be  made  between  Q-learning  and  model-based  (indirect)  approaches,  which  use  experience  to estimate  next-state  distributions  for  off-line  value  iteration?  We  first  show  that  both  Q-learning  and  the  indirect  approach  enjoy  rather  rapid  convergence  to  the  optimal  policy  as  a  function  of the num(cid:173) ber  of  state  transitions  observed.  In  particular,  on  the  order  of  only  (Nlog(1/c)/c2 )(log(N) + loglog(l/c))  transitions  are  sufficient  for  both  algorithms  to  come  within  c  of the  optimal  policy,  in  an  idealized  model  that  assumes  the  observed  transitions  are  "well-mixed"  throughout  an  N-state  MDP.  Thus,  the  two  approaches  have  roughly  the  same  sample  complexity.  Perhaps  surprisingly,  this  sample  complexity  is  far less  than  what is required for the model-based approach to actually construct a good  approximation  to  the  next-state  distribution.  The  result  also  shows  that  the  amount  of memory required  by  the model-based  approach  is  closer  to  N  than  to N 2 ‚Ä¢  For  either  approach,  to  remove  the  assumption  that  the  observed  tran(cid:173) sitions  are  well-mixed,  we  consider  a  model  in  which  the  transitions  are  determined by a fixed,  arbitrary exploration policy.  Bounds on the number  of transitions  required  in  order  to  achieve  a  desired  level  of performance  are  then  related  to  the  stationary  distribution  and  mixing  time  of  this  policy.

This global  optimisation strategy allows  us  to learn the  probability distribu(cid:173) tion of the network  weights  in  a  sequential framework.  It is  well  suited to applications involving on-line, nonlinear, non-Gaussian or  non-stationary signal processing.

Non-Linear PI Control Inspired by Biological Control Systems
Lyndon Brown, Gregory Gonye, James Schwaber
A  non-linear  modification  to  PI  control  is  motivated  by  a  model  of a signal transduction pathway active in mammalian blood pres(cid:173) sure regulation.  This control algorithm,  labeled  PII  (proportional  with  intermittent integral),  is  appropriate for  plants requiring ex(cid:173) act set-point matching and disturbance attenuation in the presence  of infrequent  step  changes  in  load  disturbances or  set-point.  The  proportional  aspect  of the  controller is  independently designed  to  be  a  disturbance  attenuator  and  set-point  matching  is  achieved  by  intermittently invoking an integral controller.  The mechanisms  observed in the Angiotensin 11/ AT1  signaling pathway are used to  control the switching of the integral control.  Improved performance  over  PI control is  shown  on  a  model  of cyc1opentenol  production.  A sign change in  plant gain at the desirable operating point causes  traditional  PI  control  to  result  in  an  unstable  system.  Applica(cid:173) tion  of this  new  approach  to  this  problem  results  in  stable exact  set-point matching for  achievable set-points.

Linear Hinge Loss and Average Margin
Claudio Gentile, Manfred K. K. Warmuth
We  describe a unifying method for proving relative loss  bounds for on(cid:173) line linear threshold classification algorithms, such as the Perceptron and  the Winnow algorithms.  For classification problems the discrete loss  is  used,  i.e., the total  number of prediction mistakes.  We  introduce a con(cid:173) tinuous loss function, called the "linear hinge loss", that can be employed  to derive the updates of the algorithms.  We  first  prove bounds w.r.t.  the  linear hinge loss  and  then  convert them  to  the  discrete  loss.  We  intro(cid:173) duce a notion of "average margin" of a set of examples .  We  show how  relative loss  bounds based on the  linear hinge  loss can  be converted to  relative loss bounds i.t.o.  the discrete loss using the average margin.

Learning Instance-Independent Value Functions to Enhance Local Search
Robert Moll, Andrew Barto, Theodore Perkins, Richard S. Sutton
Reinforcement learning methods can be used to improve the performance  of local  search  algorithms  for  combinatorial  optimization  by  learning  an  evaluation  function  that  predicts  the  outcome  of search.  The  eval(cid:173) uation  function  is  therefore  able  to  guide  search  to  low-cost  solutions  better than  can  the original  cost function.  We  describe a  reinforcement  learning method for enhancing local search that combines aspects of pre(cid:173) vious work by Zhang and Dietterich (1995) and Boyan and Moore (1997,  Boyan  1998).  In  an  off-line  learning  phase,  a  value function  is  learned  that is  useful for guiding search for multiple problem sizes and instances.  We illustrate our technique by  developing several  such functions for the  Dial-A-Ride Problem.  Our learning-enhanced local  search algorithm ex(cid:173) hibits  an  improvement of more  then  30%  over  a  standard  local  search  algorithm.

Support Vector Machines Applied to Face Recognition
P. Phillips
Face recognition is a K  class problem. where K  is the number of known  individuals;  and  support vector machines  (SVMs)  are a binary  classi(cid:173) fication method. By reformulating the face recognition problem and re(cid:173) interpreting the output of the SVM classifier. we developed a SVM -based  face recognition algorithm.  The face recognition problem is formulated  as a problem in difference space.  which models dissimilarities between  two facial images. In difference space we formulate face recognition as a  two class problem.  The classes are:  dissimilarities between faces  of the  same person.  and dissimilarities between faces  of different people.  By  modifying the interpretation of the decision surface generated by SVM.  we generated a similarity metric between faces  that is learned from ex(cid:173) amples of differences between faces.  The SVM-based algorithm is com(cid:173) pared with a principal component analysis (PeA) based algorithm on a  difficult set of images from the FEREf database. Performance was mea(cid:173) sured for both verification and identification scenarios. The identification  performance for SVM is 77-78% versus 54% for PCA. For verification.  the equal error rate is 7% for SVM and 13 % for PCA.

Unsupervised and Supervised Clustering: The Mutual Information between Parameters and Observations

Recent  works  in  parameter  estimation  and  neural  coding  have  demonstrated that optimal performance are related to the  mutual  information between parameters and data.  We  consider the mutual  information in  the case where  the dependency in the parameter (a  vector  8)  of  the  conditional  p.d.f.  of each  observation  (a  vector  0, is  through  the  scalar  product  8.~ only.

It is  shown  that standard AR-NNs  without shortcut connections are  asymptotically stationary.  If lin(cid:173) ear  shortcut  connections  are  allowed,  only  the  shortcut  weights  determine whether the overall system is stationary, hence standard  conditions for  linear AR processes  can be  used.

A Principle for Unsupervised Hierarchical Decomposition of Visual Scenes
Michael C. Mozer
Structure in  a visual  scene can  be  described at many levels of granular(cid:173)
ity.  At a coarse level,  the  scene is  composed of objects;  at  a finer level, 
each object is made up of parts, and the parts of subparts. In this  work, I 
propose a simple principle by  which  such hierarchical  structure can  be 
extracted from  visual scenes: Regularity in the relations among different 
parts of an  object is  weaker than in  the  internal  structure of a part. This 
principle  can  be  applied  recursively  to  define  part-whole  relationships 
among elements  in  a scene.  The principle does  not make use  of object 
models,  categories,  or  other  sorts  of  higher-level  knowledge;  rather, 
part-whole relationships  can  be  established based  on  the  statistics  of a 
set of sample visual  scenes. I illustrate with a model that performs unsu(cid:173)
pervised  decomposition  of simple  scenes.  The  model  can  account  for 
the  results from  a human  learning experiment on  the  ontogeny  of part(cid:173)

Vertex Identification in High Energy Physics Experiments
Gideon Dror, Halina Abramowicz, David Horn
In High Energy Physics experiments one has to sort through a high  flux  of events, at a  rate of tens of MHz,  and select  the few  that are  of interest.  One  of the  key  factors  in  making  this  decision  is  the  location of the vertex  where  the  interaction , that led  to the event ,  took  place.  Here  we  present  a  novel  solution  to  the  problem  of  finding  the  location  of the  vertex,  based  on  two  feedforward  neu(cid:173) ral  networks with fixed  architectures, whose parameters are chosen  so  as  to  obtain  a  high  accuracy.

Computation of Smooth Optical Flow in a Feedback Connected Analog Network

In  1986, Tanner and Mead [1] implemented an interesting constraint sat(cid:173) isfaction  circuit  for  global  motion  sensing  in  a VLSI.  We  report  here  a  new  and  improved a VLSI implementation that provides smooth optical  flow as well as global motion in a two dimensional visual field.  The com(cid:173) putation of optical flow  is  an ill-posed problem, which expresses itself as  the aperture problem.  However, the optical flow  can be estimated by the  use of regularization methods, in  which additional constraints are intro(cid:173) duced in  terms of a global energy functional that must be minimized . We  show how the algorithmic constraints of Hom and Schunck [2]  on com(cid:173) puting smooth optical flow can be mapped onto the physical constraints  of an equivalent electronic network.

Applications of Multi-Resolution Neural Networks to Mammography
Clay Spence, Paul Sajda
We  have  previously  presented  a  coarse-to-fine  hierarchical  pyra(cid:173) mid/neural  network  (HPNN)  architecture  which  combines  multi(cid:173) scale  image  processing  techniques  with  neural  networks.  In  this  paper  we  present  applications  of  this  general  architecture  to  two  problems  in  mammographic  Computer-Aided  Diagnosis  (CAD).  The  first  application  is  the  detection  of  microcalcifications.  The  <:oarse-to-fine  HPNN  was  designed  to learn  large-scale  context  in(cid:173) formation  for  detecting  small objects  like  microcalcifications.  Re(cid:173) ceiver  operating  characteristic  (ROC)  analysis  suggests  that  the  hierarchical  architecture  improves  detection  performance  of a  well  established  CAD  system by  roughly  50 %.  The second  application  is  to detect mammographic masses directly.  Since masses are large,  extended objects,  the coarse-to-fine HPNN architecture is  not suit(cid:173) able for  this  problem.  Instead we  construct  a fine-to-coarse  HPNN  architecture which  is  designed  to  learn  small-scale detail  structure  associated  with  the extended  objects.  Our initial  results  applying  the  fine-to-coarse  HPNN  to  mass  detection  are  encouraging,  with  detection  performance  improvements  of about  36 %.  We  conclude  that the ability of the HPNN architecture to integrate information  across  scales,  both  coarse-to-fine  and  fine-to-coarse,  makes  it  well  suited  for  detecting  objects  which  may  have  contextual  clues  or  detail structure occurring at scales  other than  the  natural scale of  the object.

Divisive Normalization, Line Attractor Networks and Ideal Observers
Sophie Den√®ve, Alexandre Pouget, Peter Latham
Gain  control  by  divisive  inhibition,  a.k.a.  divisive  normalization,  has  been  proposed  to  be  a  general  mechanism  throughout  the  vi(cid:173) sual  cortex.  We  explore  in  this  study  the  statistical  properties  of this  normalization in  the  presence  of noise.  Using  simulations,  we  show  that divisive  normalization is  a  close  approximation to  a  maximum likelihood estimator, which, in the context of population  coding, is the same as an ideal observer.  We also demonstrate ana(cid:173) lytically that this is  a general property of a  large class of nonlinear  recurrent  networks  with  line  attractors.  Our  work  suggests  that  divisive  normalization  plays  a  critical  role  in  noise  filtering,  and  that every cortical layer may be an ideal observer of the activity in  the preceding  layer.

This provides  a flexible way of dealing with uncertainties in sensor information, and al(cid:173) lows the introduction of prior knowledge into low-level perception mod(cid:173) ules.

Both approaches force  the  optimization  to  find  'interesting'  objects,  given the  sensor and object characteristics.  A  higher level  classifier  was  used  to  interpret the  results  provided by  the  model, and to reject spurious solutions.

Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machines
Kristin Bennett, Ayhan Demiriz
We  introduce  a  semi-supervised  support  vector  machine  (S3yM)  method.  Given  a  training  set  of labeled  data  and  a  working  set  of unlabeled  data,  S3YM  constructs  a  support vector  machine us(cid:173) ing  both  the  training  and  working  sets.  We  use  S3 YM  to  solve  the  transduction  problem  using  overall  risk  minimization  (ORM)  posed  by  Yapnik.  The  transduction  problem  is  to  estimate  the  value of a  classification function at the given points in the working  set.  This  contrasts  with  the  standard inductive  learning  problem  of estimating the  classification  function  at  all  possible values  and  then  using  the  fixed  function  to  deduce  the classes  of the working  set  data.  We  propose  a  general  S3YM  model  that minimizes both  the  misclassification  error  and  the  function  capacity  based  on  all  the available data.  We show  how the S3YM  model  for  I-norm lin(cid:173) ear  support  vector  machines  can  be  converted  to  a  mixed-integer  program  and then solved exactly using  integer  programming.  Re(cid:173) sults  of S3YM  and  the  standard  I-norm  support  vector  machine  approach  are  compared  on  ten  data sets.  Our  computational  re(cid:173) sults  support  the statistical  learning  theory  results  showing  that  incorporating  working  data  improves  generalization  when  insuffi(cid:173) cient  training information is  available.  In every case,  S3YM  either  improved or showed no significant difference in generalization com(cid:173) pared to the traditional approach.

A Phase Space Approach to Minimax Entropy Learning and the Minutemax Approximations
James Coughlan, Alan L. Yuille
There  has  been  much  recent  work  on  measuring  image  statistics  and  on  learning  probability  distributions  on  images.  We  observe  that  the  mapping  from  images  to  statistics  is  many-to-one  and  show  it  can  be  quantified  by  a  phase  space  factor.  This  phase  space approach throws light on the Minimax Entropy technique for  learning Gibbs distributions on images with potentials derived from  image statistics and elucidates the ambiguities that are inherent to  determining the potentials.  In  addition, it shows that if the phase  factor  can  be  approximated  by  an  analytic  distribution  then  this  approximation  yields  a  swift  "Minutemax"  algorithm  that  vastly  reduces  the  computation  time  for  Minimax entropy  learning.  An  illustration  of this  concept,  using  a  Gaussian  to  approximate  the  phase  factor,  gives  a  good  approximation  to  the  results  of  Zhu  and  Mumford  (1997)  in  just  seconds  of  CPU  time.  The  phase  space  approach  also  gives  insight  into  the  multi-scale  potentials  found  by  Zhu and Mumford  (1997)  and suggests that the forms  of  the potentials are influenced greatly by phase space considerations.  Finally,  we  prove  that probability distributions  learned  in  feature  space  alone  are  equivalent  to  Minimax  Entropy  learning  with  a  multinomial approximation of the phase factor.

Bayesian Modeling of Facial Similarity
Baback Moghaddam, Tony Jebara, Alex Pentland
In  previous work  [6, 9, 10],  we  advanced a  new technique for  direct  visual  matching  of  images  for  the  purposes  of  face  recognition  and  image  retrieval ,  using  a  probabilistic  measure  of  similarity  based  primarily  on  a  Bayesian  (MAP)  analysis  of image  differ(cid:173) ences,  leading  to  a  "dual"  basis  similar  to  eigenfaces  [13].  The  performance  advantage  of  this  probabilistic  matching  technique  over  standard  Euclidean  nearest-neighbor  eigenface  matching was  recently demonstrated using results from DARPA's 1996  "FERET"  face  recognition  competition, in  which  this  probabilistic matching  algorithm  was  found  to  be  the  top  performer.  We  have  further  developed  a  simple  method  of replacing  the  costly  com put ion  of  nonlinear  (online)  Bayesian  similarity  measures  by  the  relatively  inexpensive  computation  of  linear  (offline)  subspace  projections  and simple (online)  Euclidean norms, thus resulting in a significant  computational speed-up for  implementation with very  large image  databases  as typically encountered  in  real-world  applications.

We  propose a new in-sample cross validation based method (randomized  GACV) for choosing smoothing or bandwidth parameters that govern the  bias-variance or fit-complexity tradeoff in  'soft' classification.  Soft clas(cid:173) sification refers to  a  learning procedure which  estimates the probability  that an example with a given attribute vector is  in  class  1 vs  class O.  The  target  for  optimizing  the  the  tradeoff is  the  Kullback-Liebler distance  between  the  estimated  probability  distribution  and  the  'true'  probabil(cid:173) ity  distribution,  representing  knowledge of an  infinite  population.  The  method uses a randomized estimate of the trace of a Hessian and mimics  cross validation at the cost of a single relearning with perturbed outcome  data.

The Role of Lateral Cortical Competition in Ocular Dominance Development
Christian Piepenbrock, Klaus Obermayer
Lateral competition within a layer of neurons sharpens and localizes the  response to an input stimulus. Here, we investigate a model for the ac(cid:173) tivity dependent development of ocular dominance maps which allows  to vary the degree of lateral competition. For weak competition, it re(cid:173) sembles a correlation-based learning model and for strong competition,  it becomes a self-organizing map. Thus, in the regime of weak compe(cid:173) tition the receptive fields are shaped by the second order statistics of the  input patterns, whereas in the regime of strong competition, the higher  moments and "features" of the individual patterns become important.  When correlated localized stimuli from two eyes drive the cortical de(cid:173) velopment we find (i) that a topographic map and binocular, localized  receptive fields emerge when the degree of competition exceeds a critical  value and (ii) that receptive fields exhibit eye dominance beyond a sec(cid:173) ond critical value. For anti-correlated activity between the eyes, the sec(cid:173) ond order statistics drive the system to develop ocular dominance even  for weak competition, but no topography emerges. Topography is estab(cid:173) lished only beyond a critical degree of competition.

The technique of principal component analysis (PCA) has recently been  expressed  as  the  maximum  likelihood  solution  for  a  generative  latent  variable  model.  In  this  paper  we  use  this  probabilistic  reformulation  as  the basis  for a  Bayesian treatment of PCA.  Our key  result  is  that  ef(cid:173) fective  dimensionality  of the  latent  space  (equivalent to  the  number of  retained principal components) can be determined automatically as  part  of the  Bayesian  inference  procedure.  An  important application  of this  framework  is  to  mixtures  of probabilistic  PCA  models,  in  which  each  component can determine its own effective complexity.

We  consider recurrent analog  neural  nets  where each gate is  subject to  Gaussian noise, or any other common noise distribution whose probabil(cid:173) ity density function is nonzero on a large set.  We  show that many regular  languages cannot be  recognized by  networks of this  type,  for  example  the  language  {w  E  {O, I} * I w begins with O},  and  we  give  a  precise  characterization of those languages which can be recognized. This result  implies severe constraints on possibilities for constructing recurrent ana(cid:173) log neural  nets that are robust against realistic types of analog noise.  On  the other hand we present a method for constructing feed forward analog  neural nets that are robust with regard to analog noise of this type.

This  definition  suggests  that  to  fmd  texture  we  look  for  outliers  to  the  local  statistics,  and  label  as  texture  the  regions  with  no  outliers.

Making Templates Rotationally Invariant. An Application to Rotated Digit Recognition
Shumeet Baluja
This  paper  describes  a  simple  and  efficient  method  to  make  template-based  object classification invariant to in-plane rotations. The task is divided into two  parts:  orientation discrimination and classification. The key idea is  to perform  the  orientation  discrimination  before  the  classification.  This  can  be  accom(cid:173) plished by hypothesizing, in  turn, that the input image belongs to each class of  interest. The image can then be rotated to  maximize its  similarity to the train(cid:173) ing images in each class (these contain the prototype object in an upright orien(cid:173) tation). This process yields a set of images, at least one of which will have the  object  in  an  upright position.  The resulting  images  can  then be classified by  models  which  have been  trained  with  only  upright examples.  This  approach  has  been  successfully  applied  to  two  real-world  vision-based  tasks:  rotated  handwritten digit recognition and rotated face detection in cluttered scenes.

Outcomes of the Equivalence of Adaptive Ridge with Least Absolute Shrinkage
Yves Grandvalet, St√©phane Canu
Adaptive Ridge is a special form of Ridge regression, balancing the  quadratic penalization on each parameter of the model. It was shown to  be equivalent to Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator),  in the sense that both procedures produce the same estimate. Lasso can  thus be viewed as a particular quadratic penalizer.  From this observation, we derive a fixed point algorithm to compute the  Lasso solution. The analogy provides also a new hyper-parameter for tun(cid:173) ing effectively the model complexity. We finally present a series ofpossi(cid:173) ble extensions oflasso performing sparse regression in kernel smoothing,  additive modeling and neural net training.

This  paper  reveals  a  previously  ignored  connection  between  two  important fields:  regularization and independent component anal(cid:173) ysis  (ICA).  We  show  that  at  least  one  representative  of a  broad  class  of algorithms  (regularizers  that  reduce  network complexity)  extracts independent  features  as  a  by-product.  This  algorithm  is  Flat  Minimum  Search  (FMS),  a  recent general method for  finding  low-complexity networks with high generalization capability.  FMS  works  by minimizing  both training error and required weight  pre(cid:173) cision.

Gert Cauwenberghs, James Waskiewicz
We  present an analog VLSI cellular architecture implementing a simpli(cid:173) . fied  version of the Boundary Contour System (BCS) for real-time image  processing.  Inspired by  neuromorphic models  across  several  layers  of  visual  cortex,  the  design  integrates  in  each pixel  the  functions  of sim(cid:173) ple cells,  complex cells,  hyper-complex cells,  and  bipole cells,  in  three  orientations interconnected on a  hexagonal grid.  Analog current-mode  CMOS circuits are used throughout to perform edge detection, local inhi(cid:173) bition, directionally selective long-range diffusive kernels, and renormal(cid:173) izing global gain control. Experimental results from a fabricated 12 x  10  pixel prototype in  1.2 J-tm  CMOS technology demonstrate the robustness  of the  architecture in  selecting image contours in  a cluttered and noisy  background.

Unsupervised Classification with Non-Gaussian Mixture Models Using ICA
Te-Won Lee, Michael Lewicki, Terrence J. Sejnowski
We  present  an  unsupervised  classification  algorithm  based  on  an  ICA  mixture  model.  The  ICA  mixture  model  assumes  that  the  observed  data can  be  categorized  into  several  mutually  exclusive  data classes  in  which  the components  in each  class  are generated  by  a  linear  mixture  of independent  sources.  The  algorithm  finds  the independent sources, the mixing matrix for  each class and also  computes  the  class  membership  probability  for  each  data  point.  This  approach  extends  the  Gaussian  mixture  model  so  that  the  classes  can  have  non-Gaussian  structure.  We  demonstrate  that  this method can learn efficient codes to represent images of natural  scenes and text.  The learned classes of basis functions yield a better  approximation of the underlying distributions of the data, and thus  can provide greater coding efficiency.  We  believe that this method  is  well  suited to  modeling structure in  high-dimensional  data and  has many potential applications.

Barycentric Interpolators for Continuous Space and Time Reinforcement Learning
R√©mi Munos, Andrew Moore
In  order  to find  the  optimal control of continuous state-space  and  time  reinforcement  learning  (RL)  problems,  we  approximate  the  value function  (VF)  with a  particular class  of functions  called  the  barycentric  interpolators.  We  establish sufficient  conditions  under  which  a  RL algorithm converges  to the optimal VF,  even  when  we  use  approximate models of the  state  dynamics  and  the  reinforce(cid:173) ment functions .

Exploiting Generative Models in Discriminative Classifiers
Tommi Jaakkola, David Haussler
Generative probability models such as hidden  ~larkov models pro(cid:173) vide  a  principled  way of treating  missing  information  and  dealing  with variable  length sequences.  On the other hand , discriminative  methods  such  as  support  vector  machines  enable  us  to  construct  flexible  decision  boundaries  and  often  result  in  classification  per(cid:173) formance superior to that of the model based approaches.  An ideal  classifier should  combine these two  complementary approaches.  In  this  paper,  we  develop  a  natural  way  of  achieving  this  combina(cid:173) tion  by deriving kernel functions for  use in discriminative methods  such  as support vector  machines from  generative probability mod(cid:173) els.  We  provide a  theoretical justification for  this  combination  as  well as demonstrate a substantial improvement in  the classification  performance in  the context of D~A and  protein sequence analysis.

Learning a Continuous Hidden Variable Model for Binary Data
Daniel Lee, Haim Sompolinsky
A directed generative model for binary data using a  small number  of hidden  continuous  units  is  investigated.  A  clipping  nonlinear(cid:173) ity distinguishes the model from conventional principal components  analysis.  The relationships between the correlations of the underly(cid:173) ing continuous Gaussian variables  and the binary output variables  are utilized  to learn  the  appropriate weights  of the network.  The  advantages of this  approach are illustrated on a  translationally in(cid:173) variant binary distribution and on handwritten digit  images.

Perceiving without Learning: From Spirals to Inside/Outside Relations
Ke Chen, DeLiang Wang
As  a benchmark task,  the  spiral  problem  is  well  known  in  neural  net(cid:173) works.  Unlike  previous  work  that  emphasizes  learning,  we  approach  the  problem from  a generic perspective that does  not involve learning.  We  point out that the spiral problem is intrinsically connected to the in(cid:173) side/outside problem.  A  generic  solution  to  both problems is proposed  based on  oscillatory correlation using a time delay network.  Our simu(cid:173) lation results are qualitatively  consistent with  human performance,  and  we  interpret human limitations in  terms  of synchrony and  time  delays,  both biologically plausible.  As a special case, our network without time  delays can always distinguish these figures regardless of shape, position,  size, and orientation.

Optimizing Classifers for Imbalanced Training Sets

Following  recent  results  [9,  8]  showing  the  importance of the  fat(cid:173) shattering  dimension  in  explaining  the  beneficial  effect  of a  large  margin  on  generalization  performance,  the  current  paper  investi(cid:173) gates  the  implications of these  results  for  the  case  of imbalanced  datasets  and  develops  two  approaches  to  setting  the  threshold.

Blind Separation of Filtered Sources Using State-Space Approach
Liqing Zhang, Andrzej Cichocki
In  this  paper  we  present  a  novel  approach  to  multichannel  blind  separation/generalized deconvolution,  assuming that  both mixing  and demixing models are described by stable linear state-space sys(cid:173) tems.  We  decompose  the  blind  separation  problem  into  two  pro(cid:173) cess:  separation and state estimation.  Based on  the minimization  of Kullback-Leibler  Divergence,  we  develop  a  novel  learning algo(cid:173) rithm to train the matrices in the output equation.  To estimate the  state  of the  demixing  model,  we  introduce  a  new  concept,  called  hidden  innovation,  to  numerically  implement  the  Kalman  filter.  Computer simulations are given  to show  the validity  and  high  ef(cid:173) fectiveness of the state-space approach.

Recurrent Cortical Amplification Produces Complex Cell Responses
Frances Chance, Sacha Nelson, L. Abbott
Cortical amplification has been proposed as a mechanism for enhancing  the selectivity of neurons in the primary visual  cortex.  Less appreciated  is the fact that the same form of amplification can also be used to de-tune  or  broaden selectivity.  Using  a  network  model  with  recurrent  cortical  circuitry,  we  propose  that the  spatial  phase  invariance  of complex  cell  responses  arises  through  recurrent  amplification  of feedforward  input.  Neurons in  the network respond  like simple cells at low  gain and com(cid:173) plex ceUs at high  gain.  Similar recurrent  mechanisms  may  playa role  in generating invariant representations of feedforward input elsewhere in  the visual processing pathway.

Viewing Classifier Systems as Model Free Learning in POMDPs
Akira Hayashi, Nobuo Suematsu
Classifier systems are now  viewed disappointing because of their prob(cid:173) lems such as the rule  strength vs rule  set performance problem and the  credit assignment problem.  In order to solve the problems, we have de(cid:173) veloped a hybrid classifier  system:  GLS  (Generalization Learning Sys(cid:173) tem).  In designing GLS, we view CSs as model free learning in POMDPs  and  take a  hybrid approach to finding  the  best generalization,  given the  total  number of rules.  GLS  uses  the policy improvement procedure by  Jaakkola  et al.  for  an locally  optimal  stochastic policy  when  a  set of  rule conditions is  given.  GLS  uses GA to search for  the best set of rule  conditions.

Reinforcement Learning Based on On-Line EM Algorithm
Masa-aki Sato, Shin Ishii
In  this  article,  we  propose  a  new  reinforcement  learning  (RL)  method  based  on  an  actor-critic  architecture.  The  actor  and  the  critic  are  approximated  by  Normalized  Gaussian  Networks  (NGnet),  which  are  networks  of local  linear regression  units.  The  NGnet is trained by the on-line EM algorithm proposed in our pre(cid:173) vious  paper.  We  apply our  RL  method  to the task of swinging-up  and stabilizing a  single pendulum and the task of balancing a  dou(cid:173) ble  pendulum near the upright  position.  The experimental results  show  that our RL  method can  be applied  to optimal control prob(cid:173) lems  having  continuous  state/action  spaces  and  that  the  method  achieves  good  control  with  a  small  number of trial-and-errors.

Learning Multi-Class Dynamics
Andrew Blake, Ben North, Michael Isard
Standard  techniques  (eg.  Yule-Walker)  are  available  for  learning  Auto-Regressive process models of simple,  directly observable,  dy(cid:173) namical  processes.  When  sensor  noise  means  that  dynamics  are  observed  only  approximately,  learning can  still  been  achieved  via  Expectation-Maximisation  (EM)  together  with  Kalman  Filtering.  However,  this  does  not  handle  more  complex  dynamics,  involving  multiple  classes  of motion.  For  that  problem,  we  show  here  how  EM  can  be combined  with  the  CONDENSATION  algorithm,  which  is  based on propagation of random sample-sets.  Experiments have  been  performed  with  visually  observed juggling,  and plausible dy(cid:173) namical models are found  to emerge from  the learning process.

Markov Processes on Curves for Automatic Speech Recognition
Lawrence Saul, Mazin Rahim
We  investigate  a  probabilistic  framework  for  automatic  speech  recognition  based  on  the  intrinsic  geometric  properties  of curves.  In  particular,  we  analyze  the  setting  in  which  two  variables-one  continuous  (~), one  discrete  (s )-evolve jointly in  time.  We  sup(cid:173) pose  that the vector ~ traces out a smooth multidimensional curve  and  that  the  variable  s  evolves  stochastically  as  a  function  of the  arc  length  traversed  along  this  curve.  Since  arc  length  does  not  depend  on  the  rate  at  which  a  curve  is  traversed,  this  gives  rise  to  a  family  of  Markov  processes  whose  predictions,  Pr[sl~]'  are  invariant  to  nonlinear  warpings  of time.  We  describe  the  use  of  such  models,  known  as  Markov  processes  on  curves  (MPCs),  for  automatic speech  recognition,  where  ~ are  acoustic feature  trajec(cid:173) tories and s are phonetic transcriptions.  On two tasks-recognizing  New  Jersey  town names and connected  alpha-digits- we  find  that  MPCs yield lower word error rates than comparably trained hidden  Markov  models.

We  study  the  dynamics  of supervised  learning  in  layered  neural  net(cid:173) works,  in  the regime where the size p of the training set is  proportional  to the number N  of inputs.  Here the local fields  are no longer described  by  Gaussian  distributions.  We  use  dynamical  replica theory  to  predict  the  evolution  of macroscopic  observables,  including  the  relevant  error  measures, incorporating the old formalism  in the limit piN --t  00.

Utilizing lime: Asynchronous Binding
Bradley C. Love
Historically,  connectionist  systems  have  not excelled  at  represent(cid:173) ing and manipulating complex structures.  How  can a  system com(cid:173) posed  of simple  neuron-like  computing  elements  encode  complex  relations?  Recently,  researchers have begun to appreciate that rep(cid:173) resentations can extend in  both time and space.  Many researchers  have proposed that the synchronous firing of units can encode com(cid:173) plex  representations.  I  identify  the  limitations  of  this  approach  and present an  asynchronous model of binding that effectively rep(cid:173) resents  complex  structures.  The  asynchronous model  extends  the  synchronous approach.  I argue that our cognitive architecture uti(cid:173) lizes  a similar mechanism.

For the special  case q =  1,  the VC-dimension is  8(ws log d).

The Effect of Eligibility Traces on Finding Optimal Memoryless Policies in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
John Loch
Agents  acting  in  the  real  world  are  confronted  with  the  problem  of  making  good  decisions  with  limited  knowledge  of the  environment.  Partially  observable  Markov  decision  processes  (POMDPs)  model  decision problems in which an  agent tries to maximize its reward in  the  face  of limited sensor feedback.  Recent work has shown empirically that  a  reinforcement  learning  (RL)  algorithm  called  Sarsa(A)  can  efficiently  find  optimal  memoryless  policies,  which  map  current  observations  to  actions,  for  POMDP  problems  (Loch  and  Singh  1998).  The  Sarsa(A)  algorithm uses a form  of short-term memory  called an eligibility trace,  which  distributes  temporally  delayed  rewards  to  observation-action  pairs  which  lead  up  to  the  reward.  This  paper  explores  the  effect  of  eligibility traces on the ability of the Sarsa(A) algorithm to find  optimal  memoryless  policies.  A  variant  of  Sarsa(A)  called  k-step  truncated  Sarsa(A)  is  applied to four test  problems taken  from  the  recent  work of  Littman,  Littman,  Cassandra  and  Kaelbling,  Parr  and  Russell,  and  Chrisman.  The  empirical  results  show  that  eligibility  traces  can  be  significantly  truncated  without  affecting  the  ability  of Sarsa(A)  to  find  optimal memoryless policies for POMDPs.

Also,  a  resampling approach  is  introduced which  makes  more  effective use  of  the latent samples in evaluating the likelihood.

A V1 Model of Pop Out and Asymmetty in Visual Search
Zhaoping Li
Visual  search is  the task of finding  a  target in  an image against  a  background of distractors.  Unique features  of targets enable them  to pop out against the background, while targets defined by lacks of  features or conjunctions of features are more difficult to spot.  It is  known that the ease of target detection can change when the roles  of figure  and  ground  are  switched.  The  mechanisms  underlying  the  ease  of  pop  out  and  asymmetry  in  visual  search  have  been  elusive.  This paper shows that a model of segmentation in VI based  on  intracortical  interactions  can  explain  many  of the  qualitative  aspects of visual search.

A  robust  encoding  method  is  developed  to  meet  CMM  input  requirements .  A  hardware implementation of the CMM is  described, which gives  over 200  times  the  speed  of a  current  mid-range  workstation,  and  is  scaleable  to  very  large  problems.  When  tested  on  several  benchmarks  and  compared  with a simple k-NN method, the CMM classifier gave  less than  I %  lower  accuracy  and  over  4  and  12  times  speed-up  in  software  and  hardware  respectively.

Exploring Unknown Environments with Real-Time Search or Reinforcement Learning
Sven Koenig
Learning Real-Time A*  (LRTA*) is a popular control method that interleaves plan(cid:173) ning  and  plan  execution  and  has  been  shown  to  solve  search  problems  in  known  environments efficiently. In this paper, we apply LRTA * to the problem of getting to  a given goal location in an initially unknown environment.  Uninformed LRTA * with  maximal  lookahead always moves  on a  shortest path to the closest unvisited  state,  that is, to the closest potential goal state.  This was believed to be a good exploration  heuristic, but we show that it does not minimize the worst-case plan-execution time  compared to other uninformed exploration methods.  This result is also of interest to  reinforcement-learning researchers  since many  reinforcement learning methods use  asynchronous dynamic  programming,  interleave  planning and  plan  execution,  and  exhibit optimism in the face of uncertainty, just like LRTA *.

We  show  that  these  algorithms  compute  rigorous  lower  and  upper  bounds  on  marginal probabili(cid:173) ties  of interest,  prove  that these  bounds  become exact in  the limit  of large networks,  and provide rates  of convergence.

Where Does the Population Vector of Motor Cortical Cells Point during Reaching Movements?
Pierre Baraduc, Emmanuel Guigon, Yves Burnod
Visually-guided  arm  reaching  movements  are  produced  by  distributed  neural networks within parietal and frontal regions of the cerebral cortex.  Experimental  data  indicate  that (I) single  neurons  in  these  regions  are  broadly tuned to parameters of movement; (2) appropriate commands are  elaborated by  populations of neurons; (3) the coordinated action of neu(cid:173) rons can be  visualized  using a neuronal population vector (NPV).  How(cid:173) ever,  the  NPV  provides only  a rough  estimate  of movement parameters  (direction, velocity) and may even fail  to reflect the parameters of move(cid:173) ment when arm posture is changed.  We designed a model of the cortical  motor command to  investigate the relation between the desired direction  of the  movement, the  actual direction of movement and  the direction of  the NPV in  motor cortex. The model is a two-layer self-organizing neural  network  which  combines  broadly-tuned  (muscular)  proprioceptive  and  (cartesian) visual information to calculate (angular) motor commands for  the  initial  part  of the  movement of a  two-link  arm.  The  network  was  trained  by  motor babbling  in  5  positions.  Simulations  showed  that  (1)  the  network produced appropriate movement direction over a  large part  of the  workspace;  (2) small  deviations of the  actual  trajectory  from  the  desired  trajectory existed  at the extremities of the  workspace;  (3)  these  deviations were accompanied by  large deviations of the NPV from both  trajectories. These results suggest the NPV does not give a faithful image  of cortical processing during arm reaching movements.
