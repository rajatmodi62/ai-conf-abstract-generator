Neural Control of Sensory Acquisition: The Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex
Michael Paulin, Mark Nelson, James Bower
We present a new hypothesis that the cerebellum plays a key role in ac(cid:173) tively controlling the acquisition of sensory infonnation by the nervous  system.  In this paper we explore this idea by examining the function of  a  simple  cerebellar-related  behavior,  the  vestibula-ocular  reflex  or  VOR, in  which  eye movements  are generated to minimize image slip  on  the  retina  during  rapid  head  movements.  Considering  this  system  from  the point of view of statistical estimation theory, our results  sug(cid:173) gest that the transfer function of the VOR, often regarded as a static or  slowly  modifiable  feature  of the  system,  should  actually  be  continu(cid:173) ously and rapidly changed during head movements. We further suggest  that these changes are under the direct control of the cerebellar cortex  and propose experiments to test this hypothesis.

Modeling the Olfactory Bulb - Coupled Nonlinear Oscillators
Zhaoping Li, John J. Hopfield
The olfactory  bulb of mammals  aids  in  the  discrimination  of  odors.  A  mathematical  model  based  on  the  bulbar  anatomy  and  electrophysiology  is  described.  Simulations  produce  a  35-60  Hz  modulated activity coherent across the bulb, mimicing the observed  field  potentials.  The  decision  states  (for  the  odor  information)  here  can  be  thought  of as  stable  cycles,  rather  than  point  stable  states  typical  of simpler  neuro-computing  models.  Analysis  and  simulations show that a  group of coupled non-linear oscillators are  responsible for the oscillatory activities determined by the odor in(cid:173) put, and that the bulb, with appropriate inputs from higher centers,  can  enhance  or suppress  the  sensitivity  to  partiCUlar  odors.  The  model provides a framework  in which to understand the transform  between odor input and the bulbar output to olfactory cortex.

Efficient Parallel Learning Algorithms for Neural Networks
Alan Kramer, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli
Parallelizable optimization techniques are applied to the problem of  learning in feedforward neural networks. In addition to having supe(cid:173) rior convergence properties, optimization techniques such as the Polak(cid:173) Ribiere method are also significantly more efficient than the Back(cid:173) propagation algorithm. These results are based on experiments per(cid:173) formed on small boolean learning problems and the noisy real-valued  learning problem of hand-written character recognition.

The Boltzmann Perceptron Network: A Multi-Layered Feed-Forward Network Equivalent to the Boltzmann Machine
Eyal Yair, Allen Gersho
The  concept  of  the  stochastic  Boltzmann  machine  (BM)  is  auractive  for  decision  making  and  pattern  classification  purposes  since  the  probability  of  attaining  the network  states  is a  function  of the network energy.  Hence,  the  probability of attaining particular energy minima  may be associated  with  the  probabilities  of  making  certain  decisions  (or  classifications).  However,  because of its stochastic  nature,  the complexity of the BM is fairly  high and  therefore  such  networks  are  not  very  likely  to  be  used  in  practice.  In  this  paper  we  suggest  a  way  to  alleviate  this  drawback  by  converting  the  sto(cid:173) chastic  BM into  a  deterministic  network  which  we  call  the  Boltzmann  Per(cid:173) ceptron  Network  (BPN).  The BPN is functionally  equivalent  to  the  BM but  has  a  feed-forward  structure  and  low  complexity.  No annealing  is required.  The  conditions  under  which  such  a  convmion  is  feasible  are  given.  A  learning  algorithm  for  the  BPN based  on  the  conjugate  gradient  method  is  also provided which is somewhat akin  to the backpropagation algorithm.

Links Between Markov Models and Multilayer Perceptrons
Herv√© Bourlard, C. J. Wellekens
Hidden Markov models are widely used for automatic speech recog(cid:173) nition. They inherently incorporate the sequential character of the  speech signal and are statistically trained. However, the a-priori  choice of the model topology limits their flexibility. Another draw(cid:173) back of these models is their weak discriminating power. Multilayer  perceptrons are now promising tools in the connectionist approach  for classification problems and have already been successfully tested  on speech recognition problems. However, the sequential nature of  the speech signal remains difficult to handle in that kind of ma(cid:173) chine. In this paper, a discriminant hidden Markov model is de(cid:173) fined and it is shown how a particular multilayer perceptron with  contextual and extra feedback input units can be considered as a  general form of such Markov models.

Skeletonization: A Technique for Trimming the Fat from a Network via Relevance Assessment
Michael C. Mozer, Paul Smolensky
This paper proposes a means of using the knowledge in a network to  determine the functionality or relevance of individual units, both for  the purpose of understanding the network's behavior and improving its  performance. The basic idea is to iteratively train the network to a cer(cid:173) tain performance criterion, compute a measure of relevance that identi(cid:173) fies which input or hidden units are most critical to performance, and  automatically trim the least relevant units. This skeletonization tech(cid:173) nique can be used to simplify networks by eliminating units that con(cid:173) vey redundant information; to improve learning performance by first  learning with spare hidden units and then trimming the unnecessary  ones away, thereby constraining generalization; and to understand the  behavior of networks in terms of minimal "rules."

A Passive Shared Element Analog Electrical Cochlea
David Feld, Joe Eisenberg, Edwin Lewis
We present a  simplified model  of the  micromechanics of the human  cochlea,  realized  with  electrical  elements.  Simulation  of the  model  shows that it retains four signal processing features whose importance  we argue on the basis of engineering logic and evolutionary evidence.  Furthermore, just as  the cochlea does,  the  model  achieves  massively  parallel signal processing in a structurally economic way, by means of  shared elements.  By extracting what we believe are the five essential  features of the cochlea, we hope to design a useful  front-end  filter to  process  acoustic  images and to  obtain  a  better understanding  of the  auditory system.

Speech Production Using A Neural Network with a Cooperative Learning Mechanism
Mitsuo Komura, Akio Tanaka
We  propose  a  new  neural  network  model  and  its  learning  algorithm. The proposed neural network consists of four layers  - input, hidden, output and final output layers. The hidden and  output layers are multiple.  Using the proposed  SICL(Spread  Pattern Information and Cooperative  Learning)  algorithm,  it  is  possible  to  learn  analog  data  accurately  and  to  obtain  smooth outputs. Using this neural network, we have developed  a  speech production system consisting of a  phonemic  symbol  production  subsystem  and  a  speech  parameter  production  subsystem.  We  have  succeeded  in  producing  natural  speech  waves with high accuracy.

Modeling Small Oscillating Biological Networks in Analog VLSI

We  have used analog VLSI technology to model a class of small os(cid:173) cillating  biological neural circuits  known  as  central pattern  gener(cid:173) ators  (CPG). These circuits generate rhythmic patterns of activity  which drive locomotor behaviour in the animal.

A Bifurcation Theory Approach to the Programming of Periodic Attractors in Network Models of Olfactory Cortex
Bill Baird
A  new  learning  algorithm  for  the  storage  of  static  and  periodic  attractors  in  biologically  inspired  recurrent  analog  neural  networks  is  introduced.  For  a  network  of  n  nodes,  n  static  or  n/2  periodic  attractors  may  be  stored.  The  algorithm  allows  programming  of  the  network  vector  field  indepen(cid:173) dent  of  the  patterns  to  be  stored.  Stability  of  patterns,  basin  geometry,  and  rates  of  convergence  may  be  controlled.

We  extend  the result  to other simple networks.  This result suggests that those looking for  perfect  training  algorithms  cannot  escape  inherent  computational  difficulties just by  considering only simple or very  regular networks.  It also suggests the importance, given a training problem, of finding  an  appropriate network  and input encoding for  that problem.  It is  left as an open problem to extend our result to nodes with non-linear  functions such as  sigmoids.

This research involves a method for finding global maxima  in  constraint  satisfaction  networks.  It  is  an  annealing  process  butt  unlike  most  otherst  requires  no  annealing  schedule.  Temperature  is  instead  determined  locally  by  units at each updatet and thus all processing is done at the  unit  level.  There  are  two  major  practical  benefits  to  processing  this  way:  1)  processing  can continue  in  'bad t  areas of the networkt while 'good t areas remain stablet and  2)  processing  continues  in  the  'bad t  areast as  long  as  the  constraints  remain  poorly  satisfied  (i.e.  it  does  not  stop  after  some  predetermined  number of cycles).  As a  resultt  this  method  not  only  avoids  the  kludge  of requiring  an  externally determined annealing schedulet but it also finds  global  maxima  more  quickly  and  consistently  than  externally  scheduled  systems  the  to  Boltzmann machine (Ackley et alt 1985) is made).

A  nonlinearity  is  required  before  matched  filtering  in  mInimum  error  receivers  when  additive  noise  is  present  which  is  impulsive  and  highly  non-Gaussian.  Experiments  were  performed  to  determine  whether  the  correct clipping  nonlinearity  could  be provided  by  a  single-input  single(cid:173) output  multi-layer  perceptron  trained  with  back  propagation.  It  was  found  that a  multi-layer perceptron with one input and output node,  20  nodes  in  the  first  hidden  layer,  and  5  nodes  in  the  second  hidden  layer  could be trained to provide a  clipping nonlinearity with fewer than 5,000  presentations  of noiseless  and  corrupted  waveform  samples.  A  network  trained  at  a  relatively  high  signal-to-noise  (SIN)  ratio  and  then  used  as  a  front  end  for  a  linear  matched  filter  detector greatly  reduced  the  probability  of error.  The  clipping  nonlinearity  formed  by  this  network  was similar to that used in current receivers designed for impulsive  noise  and  provided  similar substantial  improvements in  performance.

An Adaptive Network That Learns Sequences of Transitions
C. Winter
We describe  an  adaptive  network,  TIN2,  that learns  the  transition  function of a sequential system from  observations of its behavior.

TIN-2  constructs  state  representations  from  examples  of  system behavior, and  its  dynamics are the main  topics of the paper.  TIN-I abstracts transition functions from  noisy state representations  and environmental data during training, while in operation it produces  sequences of transitions in response to variations in input.  Dynamics  of both nets are based on the Adaptive Resonance Theory of Carpenter  and Grossberg (1987).  We give results from an experiment in which  TIN2 learned the behavior of a system that recognizes strings with an  even number of l's .

Does the Neuron "Learn" like the Synapse?
Raoul Tawel
An improved learning paradigm that offers a significant reduction in com(cid:173)
putation time during the supervised learning phase is described. 
It is based on 
extending the role that the neuron plays in artificial neural systems. Prior work 
has regarded the neuron as a strictly passive, non-linear processing element, and 
the synapse on the other hand as the primary source of information processing and 
knowledge retention. In this work, the role of the neuron is extended insofar as allow(cid:173)
ing its parameters to adaptively participate in the learning phase. The temperature 
of the sigmoid function is an example of such a parameter. During learning, both the 
synaptic interconnection weights w[j and the neuronal temperatures Tr are opti(cid:173)
mized so as to capture the knowledge contained within the training set. The method 
allows each neuron to possess and update its own characteristic local temperature. 
This algorithm has been applied to logic type of problems such as the XOR or parity 
problem, resulting in a significant decrease in the required number of training cycles.

Electronic Receptors for Tactile/Haptic Sensing
Andreas Andreou
We discuss synthetic receptors for  haptic sensing. These are based on  magnetic field sensors (Hall effect structures) fabricated using standard  CMOS technologies.  These receptors, biased with a small permanent  magnet can detect the presence of ferro or ferri-magnetic objects in the  vicinity of the sensor. They can also detect the magnitude and direction  of the magnetic field.

A Programmable Analog Neural Computer and Simulator
Paul Mueller, Jan Van der Spiegel, David Blackman, Timothy Chiu, Thomas Clare, Joseph Dao, Christopher Donham, Tzu-pu Hsieh, Marc Loinaz
This  report describes  the  design  of a  programmable general  purpose analog neural computer and simulator.  It is intended  primarily  for  real-world  real-time  computations  such  as  analysis  of visual  or  acoustical patterns, robotics  and the development of  special purpose  neural nets.  The machine is scalable and  composed of interconnected  modules containing arrays of neurons, modifiable synapses and switches.  It runs  entirely in analog  mode but connection architecture, synaptic  gains and time  constants as well as neuron parameters are set digitally.  Each  neuron has a limited number of inputs and can be connected to any  but not all other neurons. For the determination of synaptic gains and the  implementation  of  learning  algorithms  the  neuron  outputs  are  multiplexed, AID  converted and stored in digital  memory.  Even at  moderate size of 1()3 to IDS neurons  computational speed is expected to  exceed that of any current  digital computer.

An Information Theoretic Approach to Rule-Based Connectionist Expert Systems
Rodney Goodman, John Miller, Padhraic Smyth
We discuss in this paper architectures for executing probabilistic rule-bases in a par(cid:173) allel manner,  using  as  a theoretical basis recently introduced information-theoretic  models.  We will begin by describing our (non-neural) learning algorithm and theory  of quantitative rule  modelling, followed  by  a discussion on  the exact nature of two  particular models.  Finally we work through an example of our approach, going from  database to rules to inference network, and compare the network's performance with  the theoretical limits for  specific  problems.

ALVINN: An Autonomous Land Vehicle in a Neural Network
Dean A. Pomerleau
ALVINN (Autonomous Land Vehicle In a Neural Network) is a 3-layer  back-propagation network designed for the task of road following. Cur(cid:173) rently ALVINN takes images from a camera and a laser range finder as input  and produces as output the direction the vehicle should travel in order to  follow the road.

Successful tests on the Carnegie Mellon autonomous navigation test vehicle  indicate that the network can effectively follow real roads under certain field  conditions. The representation developed to perfOIm the task differs dra(cid:173) matically when the networlc is trained under various conditions, suggesting  the possibility of a novel adaptive autonomous navigation system capable of  tailoring its processing to the conditions at hand.

Training a Limited-Interconnect, Synthetic Neural IC
M. Walker, S. Haghighi, A. Afghan, Larry Akers
Hardware implementation of neuromorphic algorithms is hampered by  high  degrees of connectivity.  Functionally equivalent feedforward  networks may be formed by using limited fan-in nodes and additional  layers.  but  this  complicates  procedures  for  determining  weight  magnitudes.  No direct mapping of weights exists between fully and  limited-interconnect  nets.  Low-level  nonlinearities  prevent  the  formation  of internal  representations  of widely  separated  spatial  features and the use of gradient descent methods to minimize output  error is hampered by error magnitude dissipation.  The judicious use  of linear summations or collection units is proposed as a solution.

Neural Net Receivers in Multiple Access-Communications
Bernd-Peter Paris, Geoffrey Orsak, Mahesh Varanasi, Behnaam Aazhang
The application of neural networks to the demodulation of  spread-spectrum signals in a multiple-access environment is  considered. This study is motivated in large part by the fact  that, in a multiuser system, the conventional (matched fil(cid:173) ter) receiver suffers severe performance degradation as the  relative powers of the interfering signals become large (the  "near-far" problem). Furthermore, the optimum receiver,  which alleviates the near-far problem, is too complex to be  of practical use. Receivers based on multi-layer perceptrons  are considered as a simple and robust alternative to the opti(cid:173) mum solution. The optimum receiver is used to benchmark  the performance of the neural net receiver; in particular, it is  proven to be instrumental in identifying the decision regions  of the neural networks. The back-propagation algorithm and  a modified version of it are used to train the neural net. An  importance sampling technique is introduced to reduce the  number of simulations necessary to evaluate the performance  of neural nets. In all examples considered the proposed neu(cid:173) ral ~et receiver significantly outperforms the conventional  recelver.

Learning Sequential Structure in Simple Recurrent Networks
David Servan-Schreiber, Axel Cleeremans, James McClelland
We explore a network architecture introduced by Elman (1988) for  predicting successive elements of a sequence. The network uses the  pattern of activation over a set of hidden units from time-step t-l,  together with element t, to predict element t+ 1. When the network is  trained with strings from a particular finite-state grammar, it can learn  to be a perfect finite-state recognizer for the grammar. Cluster analyses  of the hidden-layer patterns of activation showed that they encode  prediction-relevant information about the entire path traversed through  the network. We illustrate the phases of learning with cluster analyses  performed at different points during training.

A Back-Propagation Algorithm with Optimal Use of Hidden Units
Yves Chauvin
This  paper  presents  a  variation  of  the  back-propagation  algo(cid:173) rithm  that makes  optimal  use  of  a  network  hidden units  by  de(cid:173) cr~asing an  "energy"  term written  as  a  function  of  the  squared  activations  of  these  hidden units.  The  algorithm  can automati(cid:173) cally  find  optimal  or  nearly  optimal  architectures  necessary  to  solve  known  Boolean  functions,  facilitate  the  interpretation  of  the  activation  of  the  remaining  hidden  units  and  automatically  estimate the complexity of architectures appropriate for phonetic  labeling  problems.  The  general  principle  of the  algorithm  can  also be adapted to different tasks:  for  example,  it can be used to  eliminate the  [0,  0]  local minimum  of the  [-1.  +1]  logistic  acti(cid:173) vation  function  while  preserving  a  much  faster  convergence  and  forcing  binary  activations  over the  set of hidden  units.

GEMINI: Gradient Estimation Through Matrix Inversion After Noise Injection
Yann Le Cun, Conrad Galland, Geoffrey E. Hinton
Learning procedures that measure how random perturbations of unit ac(cid:173) tivities correlate with changes in reinforcement are inefficient but simple  to implement in hardware. Procedures like back-propagation (Rumelhart,  Hinton and Williams, 1986) which compute how changes in activities af(cid:173) fect the output error are much more efficient, but require more complex  hardware. GEMINI is a hybrid procedure for multilayer networks, which  shares many of the implementation advantages of correlational reinforce(cid:173) ment procedures but is more efficient. GEMINI injects noise only at the  first hidden layer and measures the resultant effect on the output error.  A linear network associated with each hidden layer iteratively inverts the  matrix which relates the noise to the error change, thereby obtaining  the error-derivatives. No back-propagation is involved, thus allowing un(cid:173) known non-linearities in the system. Two simulations demonstrate the  effectiveness of GEMINI.

The  system compares favorably with other state-of-the art recognizers. While some of  the methods are specific to this task, it is hoped that many of the techniques will  be applicable to a wide range of recognition tasks.

Convergence and Pattern-Stabilization in the Boltzmann Machine
Moshe Kam, Roger Cheng
The Boltzmann Machine has been introduced as a means to perform  global optimization for multimodal objective functions using the  principles of simulated annealing. In this paper we consider its utility  as a spurious-free content-addressable memory, and provide bounds on  its performance in this context. We show how to exploit the machine's  ability to escape local minima, in order to use it, at a constant  temperature, for unambiguous associative pattern-retrieval in noisy  environments. An association rule, which creates a sphere of influence  around each stored pattern, is used along with the Machine's dynamics  to match the machine's noisy input with one of the pre-stored patterns.  Spurious fIxed points, whose regions of attraction are not recognized by  the rule, are skipped, due to the Machine's fInite probability to escape  from any state. The results apply to the Boltzmann machine and to the  asynchronous net of binary threshold elements (Hopfield model'). They  provide the network designer with worst-case and best-case bounds for  the network's performance, and allow polynomial-time tradeoff studies  of design parameters.

Scaling and Generalization in Neural Networks: A Case Study

The  issues  of scaling  and  generalization  have  emerged  as  key  issues  in  current studies of supervised learning from examples in neural networks.  Questions such  as  how  many  training  patterns  and  training  cycles  are  needed for  a problem of a given size  and difficulty,  how  to represent the  inllUh  and how  to choose useful training exemplars,  are of considerable  theoretical  and  practical  importance.

Neural Analog Diffusion-Enhancement Layer and Spatio-Temporal Grouping in Early Vision
Allen Waxman, Michael Seibert, Robert Cunningham, Jian Wu
A  new  class of neural  network  aimed  at  early  visual  processing  is  described; we call it a Neural  Analog Diffusion-Enhancement Layer or  "NADEL." The  network  consists  of two  levels  which  are  coupled  through feedfoward and shunted feedback connections. The lower level  is  a  two-dimensional  diffusion map which  accepts  visual  features  as  input, and spreads activity over larger scales as a function of time. The  upper layer is periodically fed the  activity from  the diffusion layer and  locates local maxima in it (an extreme form  of contrast enhancement)  using a network of local comparators. These local maxima are fed back  to  the  diffusion  layer  using  an  on-center/off-surround  shunting  anatomy. The maxima are also available  as output of the network.  The  network dynamics  serves  to  cluster features  on  multiple  scales  as  a  function of time, and can be used in a variety of early visual processing  tasks such  as:  extraction of comers  and high  curvature  points  along  edge contours, line end detection, gap filling in contours, generation of  fixation points, perceptual grouping on multiple scales, correspondence  and path impletion  in long-range  apparent  motion,  and building  2-D  shape representations that are invariant to  location, orientation, scale,  and small deformation on the visual field.

Optimization by Mean Field Annealing

Nearly optimal solutions to many combinatorial problems can be  found using stochastic simulated annealing.

Mean field annealing essentially replaces the discrete de(cid:173) grees of freedom in simulated annealing with their average values  as computed by the mean field approximation. The net result is  that equilibrium at a given temperature is achieved 1-2 orders of  magnitude faster than with simulated annealing.

This paper addresses the problem of determining the weights for a  set  of  linear  filters  (model  "cells")  so  as  to  maximize  the  ensemble-averaged information that the cells' output values jointly  convey about their input values,  given  the  statistical properties of  the ensemble of input vectors.  The quantity that is maximized is the  Shannon  information  rate,  or  equivalently  the  average  mutual  information between input and output.  Several models for the role  of processing noise are analyzed, and the biological motivation for  considering them is described.  For simple models in which nearby  input  signal  values  (in  space  or  time)  are  correlated,  the  cells  resulting  from  this  optimization  process  include  center-surround  cells and cells sensitive to temporal variations in input signal.

The potential of adaptive  networks  to learn categorization rules and to  model  human  performance  is  studied  by  comparing  how  natural  and  artificial systems respond to new inputs, i.e., how they generalize.  Like  humans,  networks  can  learn  a  detenninistic  categorization  task  by  a  variety  of  alternative  individual  solutions.  An  analysis  of  the  con(cid:173) straints imposed by using networks with the minimal number of hidden  units  shows  that  this  "minimal  configuration"  constraint  is  not  sufficient to explain and predict human performance;  only a few  solu(cid:173) tions  were  found  to be  shared by both  humans and  minimal  adaptive  networks.  A  further  analysis  of human  and  network  generalizations  indicates  that  initial  conditions  may  provide  important constraints  on  generalization.  A new  technique,  which  we  call  "reversed learning",  is described for finding appropriate initial conditions.

A number of learning models have recently been proposed which  involve calculations of temporal differences (or derivatives in  continuous-time models). These models. like most adaptive network  models. are formulated in tenns of frequency (or activation), a useful  abstraction of neuronal firing rates. To more precisely evaluate the  implications of a neuronal model. it may be preferable to develop a  model which transmits discrete pulse-coded information. We point out  that many functions and properties of neuronal processing and learning  may depend. in subtle ways. on the pulse-coded nature of the informa(cid:173) tion coding and transmission properties of neuron systems. When com(cid:173) pared to formulations in terms of activation. computing with temporal  derivatives (or differences) as proposed by Kosko (1986). Klopf  (1988). and Sutton (1988). is both more stable and easier when refor(cid:173) mulated for a more neuronally realistic pulse-coded system. In refor(cid:173) mulating these models in terms of pulse-coding. our motivation has  been to enable us to draw further parallels and connections between  real-time behavioral models of learning and biological circuit models  of the substrates underlying learning and memory.

Using Backpropagation with Temporal Windows to Learn the Dynamics of the CMU Direct-Drive Arm II
Kenneth Goldberg, Barak Pearlmutter
Computing the inverse dynamics  of a robot ann is an active area of research  in the control literature.  We hope to  learn the  inverse dynamics  by training  a neural network on the  measured  response of a physical ann.  The  input  to  the  network is  a  temporal  window of measured positions;  output is  a vector  of torques.  We  train  the  network on  data measured from  the  first  two joints  of the CMU Direct-Drive Arm II  as  it moves  through a randomly-generated  sample  of "pick-and-place"  trajectories.  We  then  test  generalization  with  a  new  trajectory  and  compare  its  output  with  the  torque  measured  at  the  physical arm.  The network  is  shown  to  generalize with  a root mean  square  error/standard deviation  (RMSS)  of 0.10.  We  interpreted the weights  of the  network in tenns of the velocity and acceleration filters  used in  conventional  control  theory.

Storing Covariance by the Associative Long-Term Potentiation and Depression of Synaptic Strengths in the Hippocampus
Patric Stanton, Terrence J. Sejnowski
In modeling studies or memory based on neural networks, both the selective  enhancement and depression or synaptic strengths are required ror effident storage  or inrormation (Sejnowski, 1977a,b; Kohonen, 1984; Bienenstock et aI, 1982;  Sejnowski and Tesauro, 1989). We have tested this assumption in the hippocampus,  a cortical structure or the brain that is involved in long-term memory. A brier,  high-frequency activation or excitatory synapses in the hippocampus produces an  increase in synaptic strength known as long-term potentiation, or L TP (BUss and  Lomo, 1973), that can last ror many days. LTP is known to be Hebbian since it  requires the simultaneous release or neurotransmitter from presynaptic terminals  coupled with postsynaptic depolarization (Kelso et al, 1986; Malinow and Miller,  1986; Gustatrson et al, 1987). However, a mechanism ror the persistent reduction or  synaptic strength that could balance LTP has not yet been demonstrated. We stu(cid:173) died the associative interactions between separate inputs onto the same dendritic  trees or hippocampal pyramidal cells or field CAl, and round that a low-frequency  input which, by itselr, does not persistently change synaptic strength, can either  increase (associative L TP) or decrease in strength (associative long-term depression  or LTD) depending upon whether it is positively or negatively correlated in time  with a second, high-frequency bursting input. LTP or synaptic strength is Hebbian,  and LTD is anti-Hebbian since it is elicited by pairing presynaptic firing with post(cid:173) synaptic hyperpolarization sufficient to block postsynaptic activity. Thus, associa(cid:173) tive L TP and associative L TO are capable or storing inrormation contained in the  covariance between separate, converging hippocampal inputs ‚Ä¢

Dynamic, Non-Local Role Bindings and Inferencing in a Localist Network for Natural Language Understanding
Trent Lange, Michael Dyer
This  paper introduces  a means to  handle the critical problem  of non(cid:173) local  role-bindings  in  localist  spreading-activation  networks.  Every  conceptual node in the network broadcasts a stable, uniquely-identifying  activation pattern, called its signature.  A dynamic role-binding is cre(cid:173) ated  when  a  role's  binding  node  has  an  activation  that  matches  the  bound concept's signature.  Most importantly, signatures are propagated  across long paths of nodes to handle the non-local role-bindings neces(cid:173) sary  for  inferencing.  Our  localist  network  model,  ROBIN  (ROle  Binding  and  Inferencing  Network),  uses  signature  activations  to  ro(cid:173) bustly represent schemata role-bindings and thus perfonn the inferenc(cid:173) ing, plan/goal analysis,  schema instantiation, word-sense disambigua(cid:173) tion, and dynamic re-interpretation portions of the natural language un(cid:173) derstanding process.

Fixed Point Analysis for Recurrent Networks
Patrice Simard, Mary Ottaway, Dana Ballard
This paper provides a systematic analysis of the recurrent backpropaga(cid:173) tion (RBP) algorithm, introducing a number of new results. The main  limitation of the RBP algorithm is that it assumes the convergence of  the network to a stable fixed point in order to backpropagate the error  signals. We show by experiment and eigenvalue analysis that this condi(cid:173) tion can be violated and that chaotic behavior can be avoided. Next we  examine the advantages of RBP over the standard backpropagation al(cid:173) gorithm. RBP is shown to build stable fixed points corresponding to the  input patterns. This makes it an appropriate tool for content address(cid:173) able memories, one-to-many function learning, and inverse problems.
